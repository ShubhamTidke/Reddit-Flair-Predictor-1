16,Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule?,166,drbswn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/drbswn/will_india_and_our_highly_questionable_work/,122,"This experiment has been adopted intermittently in many parts of the world across many companies - recently it found huge success in Japan at Microsoft:

https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?",1572866844.0,"The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done.Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

From [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/):

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk.

Unless you are like a real enthu astro/aero geek. I wouldn't recommend esp with family. More than safety, it will be very tiring, if you are trying to drive up and down in one shot.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

If its not cloudy and weather is good, a night launch is pure magic.I want the answers too. Do we need to buy a ticket or something? Heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch.

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.

I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.",1582861784.0,"Well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template.... dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india. If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every rightI understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.

If you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing.No, OP.

44,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,687,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,343,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",1579006550.0,"People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

It's a little bit volatile at the moment (blame Facebook for making automation difficult) and goes down from time to time. Please be patient if this happens, it is scheduled to restart at 5:30 am IST everyday.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

So it is clear that we have legislators who are working lesser and lesser as the decades pass, both in planning and in implementation. 

The implementation reduction means that MPs aren't attending and the planning reduction means they have institutionalised working less.

It looks as if that is a very bad thing - they are not doing their work.

Which is partly true.

But I think that their job is to make laws and the lesser they work, the lesser new laws they make, the better it is.

Ideally, they should remove bad laws, and old outdated laws, debate more and amend more laws to make them more relevant, especially updating fines.

Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed.,365,eykwsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eykwsp/seattle_city_council_becomes_the_first_us/,87,"This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen.

55,What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,17,g43omc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)

Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  

*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 

In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi’s Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: “Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital’s catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?”

In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores “on a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi’s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people’s good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.”

The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore’s article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm’s previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution  “upon the removal of  “obstacles” like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices”. The firm’s past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting “an innate disrespect for the  citizen”.

In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:

“The biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elysées? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‘It brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer’s expense.”

Kishore’s essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.

In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

The prime minister’s own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn’t quite do  for Narendra Modi.

To my mind, the Modi government’s redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler’s immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean Bédel-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul’s essay ‘[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)’).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  

As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can’t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme – estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting – be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?

Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money – not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.

In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

58,Can Indians grow a spine already?,278,f2y883,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2y883/can_indians_grow_a_spine_already/,161,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go.

59,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,348,7jhqsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jhqsa/tifu_by_being_from_a_scheduled_caste_but/,264,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",1513179963.0,"You’re actually saving yourself from getting into a family of hypocrites. Not really a fuck up.

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",1584571392.0,"OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well.https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural.1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

75,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,18,fl8lmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl8lmk/appreciation_to_maharashtra_government/,23,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister. 

P.S.: These are just my own thoughts. You can choose to ignore them if you disagree",1584646611.0,"Let me explain why \*I think\* these are incorrect numbers:

Because you are comparing with the countries in west, let me tell you that those numbers are based on extensive testing on people. So if people show symptoms like cough, fever, cold, they get tested for this virus along with others. Which is why there are many positive cases in west.

Now in India, ask how many of people who have the above symptoms have got tested for this virus. Or even went to the Doctor? The less you test, the less the numbers you will get. The countries in west are already in under almost total lockdown, yet the numbers are increasing (due to the high R0 of the virus). While in India, we still have many major companies & businesses operating in full-capacity mode, big crowded markets in Mumbai still open like almost every day.  There is no point in shutting down the schools & keeping kids at home if their parents are going to work everyday in Mumbai locals & coming back home. There is absolutely no reason yet to believe that the virus hasn't really spread or the number of real infected persons are that low.

As a human first & Indian second, I really do hope that we do somehow have low numbers & we are doing a real good job. This could be one example where India could standout strong among other major countries once this is all over. But right now, it is too early to say that we are in a better position than other countries.Hi I'd like to say that I work in Healthcare in one of the biggest companies in India and even though the govt is trying to do a good job which is commendable, they've been lying about the numbers. We've known and we reported it at least two weeks ago before that info went public and also, they've messed with the numbers. It's way drastic than it seems but ofc I understand the logic behind it.

Take proper rest. Sleep on time and eat well. It'll help tremendously. Your coaching time is when you should be the most attentive, if you're having headaches, you won't be able to focus properly.

>Did you learn anything?

If I was interested in the topic and my head felt in place, the classes were indeed fun and I learnt a lot. Some of the coaching teachers are very good. If it was a difficult or boring topic, my mind usually drifted away, and not paying attention in class only caused problems in future. Reading a little about the topic that's going to be taught beforehand helps.

If you actually understand what's being taught, it'll become MUCH easier to sit through those 7 hours, trust me. If you didn't get anything in the class today, read your notes, read the textbook, watch YouTube videos on the topic. Watch the video over and over till you finally understand what your coaching teacher was trying to say. There are many good YouTube channels for JEE syllabus, they helped me more than any notes or textbook. 

If you go to the next class without knowing what was taught in this class, it'll only get worse from there.

And bro, I've been in your place. It's very difficult, but you can't do anything about it expect make sure the hardwork you do gives you the result you want. Please make a proper schedule and stick to it. Always analyze how you do the in the exams, and take them seriously. Most importantly, please don't procrastinate.

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

### Goel was elevated to the Supreme Court alongside Arun Mishra.

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him. According to an article in the Economic and Political Weekly, the check revealed that Mishra was close to the RSS. Any prior reservations were evidently put aside with the advent of the Modi government.*

\[But I couldn't search in *Economic and Political Weekly, If anyone finds the article, please do comment \].*

AK Mishra has been known for his BJP favouring judgements. [1](https://theprint.in/report/friend-of-cji-misra-target-supreme-court-judges-ire/28323/) [2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/contempt-threat-to-lawyer-justice-arun-mishra-apologises/articleshow/72380063.cms) [3](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article29897723.ece)

### Along with these 2 appointments, [The Union Law Ministry has turned down the elevation of the former Solicitor-General of India, Gopal Subramanium, as a judge of the Supreme Court](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/law-ministry-turns-down-gopal-subramaniums-elevation-as-sc-judge/article6127460.ece)

>*As an* [*amicus curiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae) *in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, Mr. Subramanium targeted the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat with new facts and was instrumental in the apex court ordering a CBI probe into the case. He was also the amicus curiae in the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple case.*

Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned.",1576897352.0,"Thank you mate <3. One day, I will go visit Pakistan and experience the culture there.Thanks for the note.

Not to take away from your points, or discredit this sub, but unfortunately I doubt this subreddit reflects the majority sentiment among India's youth. 

Uneducated bigotry and hatred among communities runs deep in this country. At a very basic level, it can dictate who gets jobs and who can and cannot rent an apartment in a locality.

This sub inspires me too, but any illusions about right wing fanaticism coming to an end in India are just that, pure delusion. This will be a long fight, and one which we must recognise is worth fighting even if we don't win in the end.Caste hindus repressing muslims these days, its a sinister ploy, so nobody turns their head  towards the upper caste hindu treatment of the low caste hindus, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.",Scheduled
82,Caste conundrum : Why do upper castes believe discrimination doesn’t exist ?,189,d6qgn0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjt8aBoejho,171,,1568987113.0,"I'm sorry but this is hilarious but at the same time it's sad af. Especially that thakur guy and that brahmin pandit. No amount of education is gonna change people like them and it's just sad to say that majority of the population in India is like them.> Brahman mandir me ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate hai

🙏

It's sad to see literates condoning casteism. How fucked up is our education system.Asking upper castes if discrimination exists is like asking white people if racism exists. Shocking as this may seem, most white people will say that ""racism used to exist 100 years ago maybe, but not anymore"".

Here's a simple idea. 90% of humans are right handed, 10% are left handed. If you look at all the students who have gotten into college and found that the split between right and left handers isn't 90-10, that's an indication that something strange is going on. If you see 95-5 or 99-1, that's not necessarily an indication that left handers are being discriminated against actively or that right handers are genetically superior, but certainly something to investigate further.

If you saw the 99-1 split in a saw mill, you might come to the conclusion that right handers are simply better, more hardworking, more deserving. After all, the interview process didn't ask them which their dominant hand was, and poor performers are fired. If you investigate, you'll realise that all your tools are designed for right handers (ask any left hander you know about scissors) and this inherent disadvantage means that they can't work effectively. But if you never investigate, you'll never find out. And even after, if you don't have the will to fix it, nothing will improve.

We need two things to solve a problem - figuring out the solution, then implementing the solution. If solving the problem would harm us, why would we bother? Why would a bunch of right handers fix the tools at the saw mill when it would increase competition for jobs?

---

And that is what reservation does. Upper castes (approx 30% of the population) would take 70-80% of the seats in higher education if there was no reservation. You might see that and think ""fair enough, if that's how the exam results look, that's the way it should be"". But we could potentially fix this by investing a *lot* more in public education, in rural education. If we paid teachers 3x more, spent 10x on teacher training, 5x more on school facilities, we would bridge the gap in 20 or 30 years. But we won't. Because the people with power and influence in society all send their kids to private schools anyway. We are not personally affected by the problem of a lack of opportunities, so we have no *incentive* to fix it, just like the right handers won't fix the tools.

If we actually fixed it and India became egalitarian, our 30% of society would only get around 30% of the seats. That's a *worse* situation than we are in currently (where we have 50%). Why would we spend thousands of crores to actually reduce the opportunities available for our kids? We won't. That's why reservation exists - to give an opportunity for the folks who went to shitty schools with shitty teachers a shot at a better life. 

---

And now you might reasonably ask - ""but look, what difference does it make? All the benefits go to a tiny minority of people from that caste."" And you are right. But you're forgetting two things. Firstly in India, people take care of their extended family. The first person from a clan to go to college and get a good job mentors their siblings and cousins, pays for their education, brings them up. 

And secondly, although most people from lower castes won't actually benefit from reservation, it's still a source of hope for them. They are poor, they have no prospects. Not only that, poor public education means their kids don't have prospects either. But they don't know it. They delude themselves into thinking their kids could potentially go to college under reservation. ""But this is horrible! These poor people are being duped!"" you might think. But it works out well for the rest of us, because the day the downtrodden majority wakes up and realises that they and their kids have no hope, they will burn society to the ground. The same will happen if reservation is stopped - because that is their only hope of a better life.

No more reservation sounds good. But all the colleges have been burned down. You'll have 100% of the seats - which are now 0. Enjoy.",Scheduled

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

Thanks you for reading and sorry for the long post.",1585843629.0,"June/July in hill stations means over crowded shit1. Yes, both of them peaceful places... The landscapes, rivers, mountains are something you should look forward in the Uttarakhand 

2. Dehradun use to have really pleasent weather (30-32° in peak summers) but hopefully Rains don't become a spoil sport :)

3. Hotels and all won't be really expensive (i guess)

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.",1582510533.0,"Beta tum subah uthke toh dekhoWoke up for a whole year at 6 am and cycled or ran for about an hour every morning.

Nothing works for everyone. You must identify the cause for your depression and do whatever to distract from it. No therapist/psychiatrist can help you like you can. See your financial situation and see what you can afford to do that you like doing.

97,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,34,f9a1i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/,17,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",1582665068.0,"Get another job and put your papers. Perks and privilege cannot compensate work-life balance.Hey, sorry to hear that you are in such situation. I can understand your dilemma. My only advice is that before you take any major steps like quitting, may be just give it a try to talk to your boss. 

From what you wrote it looks like he is a reasonable guy so may be  ask him for an unofficial coffee meeting and just calmly explains everything that you wrote here. But in a more businessy way (with concrete points, facts and numbers). For example: think from his perspective, he is the CEO of a start-up so the company's success hangs on his shoulder. You need to show him that you can do equally good or even better job in the 6 day week and contribute effectively in the company's growth. 

If its ok, you can also offer him a little reduction in your pay against one day off. Otherwise if he still disagrees try asking for alternatives, like home office or any other weekday off (where one of your colleagues can support if urgent).

No industry no matter which branch does not need to work round the clock. Even employees of emergency services like 911 work in shifts. So the expectation from company is unrealistic and by not hiring an additional resource they are just trying to save money. 

Nonetheless, if they really appreciate you and value your work they should agree to make little adjustments to keep you happy and productive. And if nothing else work then go ahead and quit. Your mental and physical health is much important and you will get another job sooner or later. All the best!Was in a similar position to yours last year , Didn't work 7 days like you but the work was intense like Going to office at 10AM and getting home at 11PM . Luckily I was an intern there So I was pretty sure I wouldn't want to join that company . I performed terribly in the last month and wasn't offered a job after the internship . Sure it took me like 2.5 month to find a new job and but it's worth it . 

Leave the current job . It isn't that bad as you think it is. Sure it will take you time to find a new job but this 7Days work is going to suck life out of you with little to no reward regarding the amount of effort you put in .

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST. 

Please be there!

102,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,8,fe9bye,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fe9bye/confession_in_a_dilemma/,11,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

You boss is not your friend.
He /she is not looking out for you but the company. 
Your goals need to align to his goals. 

He/she is not responsible for you but you company.

HR is not your friend.

You don't speak the truth to your boss
 You speak what he wants to hear.

Be diplomatic.  You have issues with work hours. 
Say
 "" I love my job, but it's exhausting to work 7 days a week, I need a break to reboot. I feel I can be more productive to the company by working extra during the 6 days and getting that one day off.""It seems that your boss is to some extent happy with you, and you aren’t a burden.

Looks like you have a work ethic as well- perhaps fewer street smarts or experience than you’d like. 

Your boss may well be right, he may well be wrong. It helps to look at objective facts.

First, you can take a day off- something that is incredibly helpful in simply staying sane. 

Having 7 day work weeks, unless you are in a rare few professions, is hard to justify.

About being destroyed - awesome! This will happen regularly, and it’s worth it as eventually you start picking up on resilience. Part of which is learning to actually value things you value. It sucks, but usually it’s either an issue of confidence or of new information which doesn’t sit well with you.

Practically, you can just shut up, get paid and get on with life.

But this depends on what goals you want to achieve.

So perhaps you could Grind it out, work towards being independent and then in a position when you can study whatever you like in peace.

Quitting a job is sometimes draining; in your case, it seems the emotional manipulation is happening because you can’t parse what is being said and place it between manipulation or advice from a more experienced person.

You are also very tired so decision making is going to be colored by that.

Do you like your work? Are you doing good work? Are you learning? Are you building a portfolio?

Your boss seems to be giving pretty decent advice on average.  he can be wrong - and that’s something you have to prove him wrong about in the long run, you don’t have to do it today. Don’t pressure yourself unnecessarily.

You have lots of challenges you are dealing with it seems, so give yourself a pat on the back for improving your work life balance and move towards getting that totally handled.

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",1583796950.0,Upvoting for visibility.

120,What kind of a doctor or treatment do I seek for Sleep Disorder?,11,f3qvfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f3qvfw/what_kind_of_a_doctor_or_treatment_do_i_seek_for/,9,"My sleep timings are 4AM to 11AM. I cannot fall asleep before 4AM and if I force myself up before 11AM it is always with a headache that lasts thought the day.

It began back in 2013 with a night shift job. I did the shift for a year but when I left the company my sleep schedule stayed the same. And now even after 7 years it is the same. Even I am to blame since after I left the job I did not try to fix my sleep times and prolonged it.

Since I am a freelancer now it doesn't affect my work but it is affecting all other aspects of my life. At times if I have to be up early I'm just miserable and cranky the whole day.

What can I do about it? What treatment works or what kind of a doctor should I see?",1581708311.0,"Try having melatonin pills just an hour before you intend to sleep. If that doesn't works, consult a doctor.Our sleep is dependent on Melatonin. And Melatonin depends on light. In natural conditions (no artificial light), Melatonin starts rising after 19:30/20:00 and peaks in the middle of the night (~ 03:00) and goes down by 07:30/08:00. [Note that the level rises over 7 hours but goes down in 4/5 hours.] As the level starts rising we start feeling sleepy. 

This is a natural cycle, which we can vary but this is something that is deeply encoded within us. We ideally shouldn't mess with this and neither mess by taking Melatonin Pills.

Another factor is the Deep Sleep/Rapid Eye Movement cycles which adapt based on your sleep duration. 

Based on the above factors and disregarding ideal conditions, this is the ideal sleep pattern:
1. The middle of the night (~ 03:00) should coincide with the middle of your sleep. 
2. Your waking time should not vary by more than half an hour, the sleeping time has more flexibility. Changing the waking time messes the Deep Sleep / REM Cycle. 

As an example, taking 6 hours of sleep, 00:00 - 06:00 is the best. For a good, 7/8 hours sleep, 23:00 - 07:00 / 22:30 - 07:00 would be the best. 


Consider the further as a Tl;dr: 

Now coming to your exact problem, if you want to solve your problem in a proper way, you need to have patience and take appropriate steps.

Decide a time you want to sleep and limit light in your environment, 2-3 hours prior with a special focus on screen brightness, filters etc. Then at your decided time, switch off the lights, switch off all screens. (If you aren't feeling sleepy, you can listen to music, even listen to movies/TV Shows/ Audio Books etc. Remember, Light is the priority.) Then no matter when you fall asleep, decide a time and get up at that moment. 

Then, during the day, do not take more than 30-45 minutes nap in the afternoon, fight off the sleep (not by OD'ing on Caffeine). Automatically, you will feel sleepy earlier the next night.

This will cause discomfort for a few days but within a few days (if everything is done right, less than a week) you will have a new sleep cycle. 
Point in favor, People who live for months in a different time zone, get over Jet Lag and get acclimatized in a few days.You cannot change your sleeping patterns overnight. Take baby steps, try sleeping at 3AM first and do that for a couple of weeks, then change it 2 and so on until you reach your desired goal. Make sure you tire yourself throughout the day, exercise, go to the gym, run, do anything than be idle all day.",Scheduled

124,Either India's property developers are insane or I am.,196,d4jscs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4jscs/either_indias_property_developers_are_insane_or_i/,155,"I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality


Can't wait to hear how millennials killed the realty sector",1568579178.0,"Try Faridabad, Noida or Ghaziabad. Delhi, due it development commands a hell lot of price in the property market. Gurgaon was once for those who couldn't afford a home in South Delhi. Thanks to corporate invasion, Gurgaon too has become expensive even after having terrible infra. Meanwhile, in Noida Extension, you'll find guys jumping in the middle of the road trying to sell a 3bhk for 30 lacs ( that too is negotiable). At the end of the day, all boils down to demand supply and development.Truth is, nobody is buying. Larger Builders are forced to launch to cover costs of old projects, continuously be able to make debt payments, while raising more debt, monetize existing land inventory and most importantly to keep up appearances. My suggestion is to look for builders who have less than 10 projects and are heavily focused on per project profitability and not company wide profitability or best buy plot and build. DM if you have questions.It doesn't make any sense, you are being charged premium for an apartment which is not yet built and will also depreciate with time, not to forget it's at a location which MAYBE developed in the next few years.

We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

If say India reaches 2.0 fertility rate in next five years and continuues trends, India will have 1.8 billion people by 2060.

136,Most effective way to deal with Indian clients.,18,es75b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es75b5/most_effective_way_to_deal_with_indian_clients/,11,"Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?",1579697904.0,"Do you tell clearly that x minutes are free and you have to pay beyond that?

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

143,My recent experience with a NEXA dealership.,44,eihedp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eihedp/my_recent_experience_with_a_nexa_dealership/,16,"TLDR: Don’t take the word of a car dealership/service station at its face value. Do your due diligence, ask around  before committing to any off the schedule repair/maintenance. 

So about 3 weeks back, I borrowed a near new condition Ignis (about 2.5 year old and less than 15k kms) from a cousin and drove to about 130kms to a town nearby for some urgent family matter. 

15 mins into the drive, the steering felt a bit strange and I stopped over to check. Upon inspection of the tires and the engine bay, everything seemed ok. But thought I’d get the wheels balanced and aligned once I reach my destination. So I refilled the tires with correct air pressure (which was off a bit) and went on my way.

Drive to the destination was fine and mostly highway driving. Upon reaching my destination I noticed that the car’s front tire assembly would make a funny sound on sharp turnings, as I was parking it. Opened up the hood and saw a lot of grease/oil smeared near the passenger cv shaft ( the rod that connects the engine to the tire and drives it). I immediately knew that the CV boot ( rubber cover around a bearing) had busted and had spilled all its grease. 

But just to be sure and since this was not my car, I took it straight to the Nexa showroom, while I also calling the owner of the car. The Nexa showroom people pointed me to the their service station, which thankfully wasn’t that far. Nobody at the showroom bothered to come see the car and see if it was even drivable (or safe to drive). But I can understand since this was just a sales showroom.

Upon reaching the service centre the foreman inspects the car and says that the whole cv shaft is broken and would need a replacement. I asked if he was 100% sure and asked to see the owner for confirmation. The owner repeats the same and they quote me Rs 7000 (plus labour) for the fix and ask me to leave the car there for a few days as they would need to order the part. I asked them to provide me with a inspection/quotation paper. Which they did. I then tell them that according to my experience and knowledge only the cv boot needs replacement. They totally dismissed my input. By this time I had already removed the car from their service station and parked it outside. 

I then call my cousin and explain the whole situation in front of the service station owner and the foreman. I tell him what the Nexa service people think was the problem and the price and time associated with the fix. He then asks me what my opinion was, and I tell him that that the CV shaft in my opinion was ok and only the boot/rubber cover needs replacement and refilling with grease. Since the wheel still had power and the CV shaft was intact in one piece, and the reason for the sound was no/low grease around the cv bearing. I tell him that I knew that the CV shaft was fine and only the boot/rubber covering was broken since about 4 years ago I had personally replaced the whole CV shaft on my own car (common issue on older cars) and know about these issues.

After hearing this, the owner leaves and the foreman asks me to sign the quotation/service form which now states that they couldn’t repair the car because of “unavailability of part”. 

After that, I go to a car repair market nearby and consult with the mechanic there. Who confirms my diagnosis. And after confirming with my cousins, he fixes it within 1.5 hours for a total of Rs 700. The car drives fine, no problems since. 

Knowing that this was not my car, I would have happily paid more that Rs 700 if Nexa service people were willing to replace the cv boot. Maybe just maybe they don’t replace the cv boot, period. But at least they could have been honest with me and not miss diagnosed the issue. I never trusted car dealerships and their service stations, this just added to the list.",1577906608.0,"FWIW all service centres are like this. Unless you really make a stand and fight it out, they'll insist on replacing the entire part instead of a minor part or even fixing the problem.Shouldn't insurance be covering these cases?

I'm not directly blaming BJP over this \[contrary to the title\].

But let's take a look:

1. Jagdish Singh Khehar's case related to the death of  K Pul.
2. Dipak Mishra: K Pul case &  Bribery case.
3. Ranjan Gogoi : Sexual harassment case.

In all 3 cases, BJP Govt came heavily in support of these judges.

Did it make these judges to incline towards BJP?

Had there been proper protocols to deal with such incidents, which upholds the integrity of SC, wouldn't it be better?

151,Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,2,ee2yz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2yz1/are_the_students_of_jamia_millia_islamia_really/,23,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.

&#x200B;

While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.

  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)

  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.

  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.

  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.

  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:

  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.

  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 

  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.

  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.

  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!

  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)

  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.

  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!

  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?

  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.

  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.

  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 

  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.

  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",1569016735.0,"Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them.So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that.",Scheduled

This year itself The Favourite and Widows didn't get a release even after getting release dates and social media confirmation from the studio. Got pulled last minute. I fear the same has happened with Ad Astra. Its definitely not a CBFC issue since I couldn't see any content in Ad Astra (from the trailer and reading revews whatever I understood) that would cause problem or wouldn't suffice an A rating.Not gonna lie. Spent the last hour calling Theaters and asking them when ad astra was releasing. They said it's definitely not releasing this week, but might be the next. I wouldn't put too much money on that.

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

171,DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference),19,dsirfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsirfe/do_and_dont_of_flight_travel_due_to_increase_in/,18,"Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem. And if they can't, chances are you were the reason ( Like you coming 40 mins before flight and check in is closed.) Don't be the guy who screams - I KNOW YOUR MANAGER/MAALIK/OWNER/DAD etc. 

4. DO NOT worry that you will crash lol. Many people who are travelling for first time may be scared. I don't blame them as flight crashes are always big news.

However rest assured because the chances that you will get into a car accident is HIGHER compared to you getting in flight accident. Seriously. It is THAT safe.

If I remember more stuff, I will mention it here. Others also please combine and add stuff which I may have forgotten. I am a busy man",1573086837.0,">I am a busy man

I know it's been a long time I haven't updated what happened thereafter because I got really busy with them. It wasn't easy raising them, they are just like human babies. 

**The journey until the weaning process:**

Soon after making the post in the afternoon I went to a pet store and got Royal Canin (RC) Babydog milk. The making of the milk was very easy, you just have to add warm water and mix according to the label. it comes with feeding bottle and different nipples for cats as well as for dogs. You can use little more or less powder according to your preference, depending how well the puppies are able to tolerate. It had a very bad smell, so bad that I had to wear some masks whenever I used to feed them lol. After few days I got adjusted to the smell. 

also we found out that the babies are only 1 weeks old, their mom died on the night before we took them home.

Don't forget he milk: There's two options that are generally available in pet stores. One is RC Babydog milk and another one is from Beapher Lactol which doesn't come in large packs, overall RC is cheaper (still costly)

Bedding: For bedding we used a hot bag in the lower portion of a carton (big amazon boxes), then some clothing, bed sheet on top of it and newspapers on top of all of them. Basically created a layer so they don't feel the hot bag but continue to get a warm environment. The temperature is extremely crucial to newborn babies as they aren't able to generate or regulate temperature on their own, they rely on their mother for it. The temperature shouldn't be too much or too low, place your hand on the top of bedding if the heat is tolerable only then place them on top of that else just add some little less hot water next time or put some more clothing in the box. Too much warmth can lead to hotspots, blisters on their skin. 

You have to keep in mind their feeding timeline too. For newborns according to breed size (pariah dogs are medium breeds) you have to feed them 8 times in 24 hours. Again you can break them in even more smaller batches. I used to feed them every 1 or 2 hours apart. Gradually increase the gap when they grow up. Don't feed them too much as that may lead to diarrhea. [Here's a chart printed on Royal Canin's Babydog milk.]

When it comes to toilet they don't urinate on their own. You have to take a cotton boll, dip in lukewarm water and stimulate their genitalia to make them urinate. For potty there's no option so keep them over newspaper and replace them when you see them doing potty. The potty is watery because well all  they are just drinking is milk. If you see them covered up in potty just take some cotton balls and clean them with lukewarm water. 

Take care of mosquitoes too, I used to keep some mosquito coils, or good knight burning all the time. 

All was going well until I ran out of RC Babydog milk, I couldn't find it in local pet stores. So I ordered online from Amazon. Was getting good deal on 2kg pack. Sadly it could arrive two days later. 

I contacted some vet and they said to give them amul spray. I didn't like this plan as cow milk has good amount of lactose which is bad for dogs. Seeing no option I had to give them the amul spray by mixing in water. 

It went fine for two days, no digestion issues popped up. Meanwhile the RC milk arrived, this is where comes the saddest part of raising them. 

None of them were able to tolerate the RC milk for some reason, they instantly vomited. Being a noob we continued to give them the RC milk. Three went back to normal ish but one didn't recover. We contacted another vet who told me it's probably because of sudden diet change. They have extremely sensitive stomach and any sudden change would screw them up. The amul spray we used to give had more lactose content which probably made their stomach bad with the lactose content that is why maybe they weren't able to tolerate the RC milk later. Vet told us to give less amount of powder in more water.

Few days later the dog which was affected worse died. :( 

This incident took a toll on other dogs too, they used to vomit a lot after eating. We couldn't find why but came to conclusion it's probably because they used to drink milk in a hurry. So we made some changes in feeding timeline and went with small batches inbetween so that they don't become very hungry. 

**The weaning process:**

1 month later I started the weaning process with Royal Canin Starter as suggested by vet. I tried first by giving them as it is but nope, they would smell  but wouldn't eat. Then I actually read instructions. :p

According to instructions I soaked them in lukewarm water, wait until the pellets become soft then mash them and make a porridge. It also had a very bad smell but tolerable. The smell is extremely important because that's what makes it attractive to them. They would just gobble up their food. I used to give it 5 times a day. Morning at 7am - 10am - 12pm - 6pm - 9pm. 

Yes you can give them rice, daal at this point but some won't like it. It's easier to feed them ""mashed pellets turned into a porridge"". If RC is costly for you Pedigree has same starter food. 

**The worst part of weaning process, the nightmares:** 

After few weeks later they weren't eating the porridge. Again being a noob I didn't understand that it's time to give them solid food because their teeth has grown. Also maybe they just got bored. 

I bought Pedigree starter and made same porridge. This time they ate like they used to before but again some days later they lost interest. That's when I found out it's time for them to eat solid foods. Also found out I'm supposed to give them Royal Canin Medium/Maxi Starter and not Mini. Yes these brands have created different products based on size of breeds. Confusing af. 

So anyway I got the Maxi starter, they used to eat but again stopped eating. This caused me nightmares and I had sleepless nights thinking why they aren't eating. 

Now Royal Canin was getting really costly as they grew up so I tried Pedigree Pro Starter. They liked it a lot but after some day same result, they won't eat. I tried many brands like Purina, Hill's and same result on everything. Luckily they found cheap Pedigree milk and chicken tasty and business as usual. But another problem started up, some used to vomit after eating. Again we found the culprit was eating too fast and drinking a lot of water after eating which is normal in pellet diet. 

After 1 month In between of those pellets and vomiting we tried rice, daal which they didn't like at first, but they absolutely loved rice+curd (amul masti dahi), then as they grew up we started giving them veggies, eggs which also they loved. 

The schedule was: veggies like potato, carrot, pumpkin in the morning. Curd rice at lunch and daal, roti at night. Eggs once a day. Our family has turned completely vegetarian so no nonveg like meat. I know it's foolish, I do give them Pedigree once in a while and eggs. The diet is still the same till date. Dogs are actually omnivorous unlike cats.

**Poops, urine everywhere..**

You'll see them finding their own spot for urinating and pooping, it's extremely crucial to train them else you'll have to deal with poops on floor and urines. Watch some videos on how to potty train, or better hire a trainer. We didn't do any of that in time and as a consequence mine poops everywhere. Still untill they get trained you have to deal with the poops. Better get cheap toilet paper rolls from Amazon, Bigbasket. Buy their own brand like Presto, Solimo and bbhome. To clean the urines get a scotch brite jumper spin mop and some microfiber clothes as they soak more water. Also keep lizol, dettol handy to clean the floor after each poop.

**The de-worming process.**

You have to deworm them periodically before the first vaccination, else vaccination will get wasted. Like humans they also have tapeworms, a lot. Vet suggested us Drontal puppy. You first need to weight the puppy and give 1ml/kg body weight. 

Now how do you weight the puppy? Weight yourself first in a scale then substract it from the weight of you holding the puppy on the scale. Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes with a dropper to measure and feed the puppy. 

Be prepared to see a lot of tapeworms coming out in dog's poop. ALWAYS directly apply dettol, lizol on floor and mop during this time. 

Deworm 14days in between during vaccinations.

**The vaccinations.**

After two months from the post (from their birth date) it was vaccination time. Our vet came to our home and did all the vaccinations. 

* 2 months after birth: DHPPi - For Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo virus and Para-influenza virus.

* 3 months after birth - 1 month after initial DHPPi - DHPPi booster. 

* 4 months after birth - 1 month after DHPPi booster - Rabies shot.

* 5 months after birth - 1 month after rabies shot: Corona shot. 

From second year onwards you have to give DHPPi booster, Rabies booster, and you can give cororna but I feel it's not necessary as this virus is not widespread in India. So two shots in total. 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k for DHPPi, 2k for DHPPi booster, 1.7k for rabies and 1.8k for Corona. This is total cost of three dogs and doc's charge for coming to home. 


**The first bath:**

Ideally you shouldn't give them bath until few weeks past the first vaccine shot. But you can use Himalaya Freshcoat. You need to spray them over their coat and dry them off with a towel. After the first vaccine I'd suggest to wait for two weeks and give them bath in lukewarm water with Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo.

**Holy mites (and fleas).**

If you are adopting a street dog then it's most likely to come with some parasites. Often it comes from mom and environment. You won't notice them until they are 1 or 1.5 and even later days months old. You'll probably notice some bumps, redness, poor coating, blood. Sadly our dogs came with parasites and got [affected in the worst way.](https://imgur.com/a/ApNnu1n) As we couldn't bath them until vaccination we had to use erina fresh coat spray and Erina powder. Those didn't help at all, there was flesh wounds. We used to give Wokazole lotion, Himalaya Scavon spray and they did help to recover from the wounds. They were also itching very badly so doc gave some injections (after first vaccination) which costed us ₹600. 

Those insects also affected me and my mom. Mites spread fast and also on humans. Luckily they don't last long on human. I got redness and bumps all over my elbow and shoulders during that time. My mom got itching for a month! She had to take some anti histamine. 

It's an endless battle. This issue is still present on them, I shower them with two shampoos: bolfo and erina coat cleanser every week with spot on application evey two months. Their coat is way better now. 

**The fights and battles:**

I got two males and one female dog. Earlier they used to eat together but as they grew up they started to fight with each other during eating. One would eat other's food but won't let anyone touch their plate lol. So had to give them food in three rooms which I still do. 

**My deteriorating health during this time:** 

I was really frustrated with the redness and bumps all over my body, also got deeply scratched by them. The scratch happened before they got their rabies vaccine so I was really scared of getting rabies as I didn't have any prior rabies vaccination. I went to a doc and he suggested 5 dose of rabies vaccine on  day 0, 3rd, 7tg, 14th and 28th day.

 Then one day when they were fighting I tried to separate them and by mistake my thumb got punctured into one's lower tooth. It was very deep so I got even more scared, there was endless blood, pain. I washed my thumb into running tap water and also used detergent. Went to same doc in evening, he said not to worry as I was already getting vaccinations so RiG is not needed (Rabies immunoglobulin). He gave me instructions to complete 3 tetanus shots and gave some antibiotic ointment. 

During my last rabies shot I got pneumonia/bronchitis, wasn't able to get up from bed, Had extreme fever of 104-105 and fever stayed there for three days straight, also was experiencing terrible chest pain while getting up or trying to sleep. Mom went to medicine shop and they gave some paracetamol and antibiotic which helped a little but the fever woukd again shot up to 104-105. 

Four days later I went to doc and he gave me same paracetamol, antibiotic but also added penicillin.Which helped tremendously and my fever was gone in next few days. 

But after the fever went away the chest pain didn't. It haunted me for months. Doc prescribed some paracetamol to help and some syrup. In the end it went away. 

Meanwhile while visiting the medicine shop for my last vaccine of rabies they said it won't help if I get the rabies shot that time because it was late. In confusion wheather to start rabies shots again from day 0, I took the last shot and went to doc. He said no worries. 

**Finally here's how they looks now:**

[This one is a male, we call him babla/tiya(Bengali name, tiya means parrot).](https://i.imgur.com/WcIt2Xv.jpg) He's nicest of the bunch, always stays away from fight.

**Some do and don'ts for someone willing to rescue a puppy, or looking to own a dog:**

**Do:**

* Always consult a vet.

* For strays check with locals for approx date of birth, it helps. 

* Stock cheap toilet papers, cotton balls, lizol, dettol, newspapers. You are gonna need it. 

* Always clean floor with dettol after they do their business if they aren't trained. 

* Buy Erina Freshcoat, Erina EP powder. Use them until first bath, this will help with parasites. Also any clotrimazole dusting powder during rainy seasons. Wokazole Plus lotion, scavon spray.

* Deworm properly and carefully. 

* If you are giving them amul milk, amul spray make sure to use little milk, powder and mix with water. 

* Pedigree Pro is a good alternative to Royal Canin. 

* Fresh veggies and foods should be prioritised over pellets. (If you have time)

* Give them treats when they are nice and obeyes your orders. Like hug them a lot. 

* Trim their nails frequently.

**Don't:**

* Do not suddenly change their diet when they are young, this could turn into fata casuality. Always keep in mind the transition period where you have to mix some of old food with new food and gradually increase new food over the period. 

* For newborns ALWAYS check for bedding temperature. Make sure it's tolerable, not too high or low. 

* Milk is always a no no. Curd is good because it has probiotics which helps with digestion. My dog loves amul masti dahi. 

* Don't leave too much gap between meals for young dogs, if their  stomach gets too much empty they'll might vomit during morning or anytime. 

**Was it worth it?**

I would say yes, during this time I got really attached to them. I knew what it takes to raise a child. 

Yes they are always fighting, ruined our walls, our new sofa, our washing machine cover. Our fridge. They wake me up at 5 demanding breakfast, there was a time when I had to wake up at 5 to make breakfast for them. One urinates like fountain. One urinates everywhere. I always get scratched by them. We spent about  ₹10-15k in vaccines, milk, endless bottles of shampoos, scavon spray, Wokazole lotion, spot-ons. 

But all those nuisance doesn't feel bad at all whenever my sister comes home from work and they licks her face with love. You got to see them in person lol, they would make different sounds, gets all excited after hearing door bell then jumps onto her. Same with me and my mom whenever we enter home. 

This turned out to be quite a long post, so sorry for that. Also sorry to everyone who has pmed me and I didn't reply, I was really busy with all these.

200,A polite request to all Indians here,401,g2ct57,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ct57/a_polite_request_to_all_indians_here/,82,"I don't know if it is the same situation in other countries, but in India, I have seen A LOT of organisations which have very toxic environments.

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out.""

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible.

He was expected to be on ground to protest against the genocide, he didn't even held a press conference against it.

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",1585485942.0,"""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phraseFeel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one. It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended.

I've been saying this since 1999. Heck even Bollywood made movies on this same issue over and over again. We respected Army to the core but also kept them on pedestal for these crimes as well. We never were blind supporters of anybody. That's why we were free to question every institution without fear. Today people say ""you are crazy to question Army"" and institutions? Well very convenient, who gave you that message, the perpetrators and it's supporters I guess. Well a Rapist never likes to be called out for the crimes he did, why would he support the idea of questions?

Rest of the points, you described India in general since 2014. And these same people had problems when petrol prices were 5 rupees high. Now they don't question even when it is +50 rupees high. Vegetables and rest other commodities +100 high. Because their brain has been washed. The media, the it cell, the zero pressure govt and it's institution, the fear mongering, has made people fearful and weak. 

Don't even for a minute ever think that this attempt to shoot was to create fear among Shaheen Bagh protestors. No, they are fearless and are not afraid to die even though they are dying slowly by protesting.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.",1587474023.0,"Every human being is different, so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salt:


There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. 

Perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you've joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:

- What does your family think about X?
- What can we do to set them at ease about X?
- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?
- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?

Get yourselves on the same team, so that you're not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. 

Once more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.Dude. I’m an Indian girl engaged to a non indian, and half my family still doesn’t know. Trust me, it’s less drama this way.Ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing. How does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? How old are you both?",Politics

283,101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],256,g0dofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0dofi/101_years_of_jallianwala_bagh_massacre_background/,52,"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",1580471131.0,"Something like Cuba and pretty much under a left dictatorship and would have moved in the same direction as PakistanIt's a counter factual - i.e., a logical fallacy.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",1574808704.0,"As someone who doesn't follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened.

- Meanwhile, The Indian Express has asked employees to take pay cuts. On 1 April, in an email to employees, CEO George Varghese wrote: “Vendors are insecure, RWAs (Resident Welfare Association) are insecure, the rail, road and air lockdown has grounded distribution, businesses are shut down, we have been compelled to reduce print orders in all centres.”

- On 10 April, Hindi News channel News Nation fired its entire English digital team of 15 journalists, despite the Narendra Modi government’s advisory urging public and private companies to not cut salaries or fire people during the lockdown.

- The Times of India has also allegedly sacked its entire Sunday magazine team. In a Facebook post, journalist Nona Walia claimed: “The entire team of Sunday magazine of Times of India asked to leave. Got a call from my boss Poonam Singh. Sacked after 24 years from a company I served with love for more than two decades. Wow.”

- Moreover, about half the employees working at The Quint, a digital media website, have been sent on leave without pay. A newsroom note accessed by ThePrint stated: “We are forced to request you to proceed on a ‘furlough’ (ie, leave without pay, LWP) wef the 15th of April, until further notice. Your pay for the half-month, from April 1 through 15, shall be processed and released very soon.”

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things.

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time.

I understand that Maharashtra has major urban cities with a huge influx of foreign and national migrants. Wouldn't he be doing a good job if regardless of that there'd be lesser cases? Maha has 3000+ cases and how can that be translated to a good job? Also the Bandra station issue. If the govt has done a good job for them, why will they want to go back?

1. He is seeking advice from healthcare & finance experts before taking any action. 
2. Not tolerating the Hindu Muslim divide politics.
3. He is communicating clearly. 
4. He is not playing blame game in this situation.
Although there is lot that his government have to do the most important reason personally is,
I live in Kolhapur sangli flood affected area, I have seen how last govt responded to flood situation. When I compare to last govt he is doing 10 times better.

1. Communicating very well being very     honest about the situation.

2. Trying his best to provide food to the labourers. He said rn he is providing food to 80000 people and will further increase the quantity.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies.

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",1587316954.0,">Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.


Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.


I like your interesting take on Mamata where you've conveniently ignored the following:


1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn't bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There's too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. 


2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. 


3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what's she's doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that's not bjp propaganda. I'm receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there's state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there's co-morbid conditions, you'll not even die from covid, that doesn't mean it's not spreading.


4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state's industrial output? Where are the jobs? We've all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?


5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn't have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn't get to decide who gets citizenship. We don't want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?


There's no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she's just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal's industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That's all there is to it.


Bengali's have no hope left. It's TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that's probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali's are leaving the state, who's gonna rise to the occasion?There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.

During the lockdown I was visiting my parents. We live in a large joint family setting. Now my every morning starts with Hindu Muslim hate speech as newspapers (Hindi) are read and tv news channels are put on loud. Of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne? Gaddar hain ye log. Modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. Inka ek hi ilaaj hai. Line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”

Given how well written this piece is I passed this around a few friends and one of them happened to be a huge supporter of Modizi.

Then you have to dissect each article. Identify their claims.

Then use your knowledge of history and the context the piece is written in to scrutinise each claim. Go at it with a scalpel, so to speak. If you find yourself unfamiliar with the topics being raised and the themes being discussed, then start doing research on these topics.

For me personally both articles are largely full of hot air, and of not much significance outside of intellectual masturbation.

While Taseer has a claim in that he has held PIO/OCI status for decades in spite of his Pakistani origin, it is also a fact that clerical error by the government is not an excuse to bestow unauthorised privileges to any individual ineligible for them.

On the other hand, Singh plays the ""what about Pakistan and the UK"" card, aka *tu quoque* or the appeal to hypocrisy fallacy to discredit Taseer's claims. After all, India's actions should be reactionary to what Pakistan or the UK are doing and there are no better standards than these two countries if we do have to compare.I don't think an op-ed should lead you to form your mind on anything. If that was the case then Aatish Taseer's post is more articulate, less hateful and obviously more credible. 

Evaluate the facts, and let your own sentiments guide you. Do you agree or disagree with the people who are saying these things and if so, why ?Considering the hit piece on Aatish reads like a  juvenile retort with shit like 

> Aatish Taseer is both Indian and Pakistani and neither; neither Hindu nor Muslim, but also both; colored, immigrant in the West; an exotic dream of all the feminists; male and female; of every democracy where universities are factories for pumping out legions of Social Justice Warriors.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",1587389800.0,"Meanwhile cops turn a blind eye to everything else,like the recent  wedding which took place courtesy of Kumaraswamy.I guess it  really is true that the rich can bend the rules,while the rules can be used to bend over a common man like me.Really sorry for your dad’s shitty experience. Power really does go to anyone’s head. Especially the people with minimal amounts of power.

Completely unrelated but you calling your family nakama threw me off. Wasn’t expecting that there. :)Tldr; Duh, yes

Full version : yes definitely. Imagine if you had been in a Mercedes or BMW. No cop would even dare to touch you or your car even. Money and power definitely work everywhere and laws are mostly to protect the wealth of rich and the power of those already in power. Common people are expected to follow the law. Those who question the status quo are branded as radicals and those who follow are rewarded with positions of power.

A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.

Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them. 

Please think  again, if you think my thoughts have political origin.",1585357634.0,"I absolutely see the need for this lockdown. If we don't, this disease will spread unchecked and kill _a lot_ of people, mostly these poor guys who are already malnourished and living in horrid conditions.  

_But_ the government should have first implemented a system where there are daily or weekly food deliveries to the poor. We can't let them just starve. Additionally they should have implemented a freeze on rent payments or a government subsidy for those landlords so the poor aren't burdened with it. Food, water and shelter should have first been guaranteed by the government _before_ the lockdown. 

As for allowing them to go home before the lockdown, that is not at all wise. Because of the inadequate testing done by the government we don't know the extent of the spread within cities. We're fairly confident the spread is limited in rural areas though but even that isnt 100% certain, because again, we're not testing nearly as much as we should. 

But allowing mass migration of millions of people from urban to rural is a good way to make sure this virus spreads rapidly among India's impoverished rural population. And mark you, the healthcare infrastructure in rural India is woefully inadequate. We're already going to struggle with the overstretched healthcare facilities in cities. Rural India isn't even close to being prepared for this. Look at how it's ravaging Italy and the US. Imagine the damage it will do here where our healthcare facilities are inadequate in the best of times, where we have high population density, poverty and malnourishment. 

This isn't just a pandemic anymore it's atleast two disasters rolled into one. We're going to see massive unemployment, we're going to see a lot of businesses, big and small, failing. We're going to see a global economic depression not seen since 1929 and maybe even worse than that. And if this disease gets _really_ bad we're going to start seeing a breakdown of our food production and distribution because the poor that grow our food will be sick or dying in droves. Which means, in India alone, millions of deaths from famine, food riots in cities and a possible breakdown of law and order. Of course, this is a worst case scenario and hopefully things won't get so bad but preventing that means we need to take this virus _very seriously_. 

So if the government is finally taking extreme measures to slow the spread then yeah I support it. I don't support the fact they did not account for the well being of the poor before doing this, which they should have. But this lockdown...it's necessary. 

Look, If we're looking at this realistically, there is no 'flattening the curve' for India. The window for that has passed. Cases will spike and it will overwhelm our healthcare system. People are going to die because there won't be enough ICU beds or enough ventilators. The only thing this lockdown will achieve in my opinion is that it will delay that spike, buying the government crucial time to acquire or manufacture more PPE, ventilators and beds. At the very least they can try to raise the bar on the capacity of our healthcare infrastructure so that fewer people die. The government should have started preparing two months ago, we should have converted factories to manufacture PPE and ventilators back then. But like most governments the world over, they were slow to react. And the price for that early inaction is we go into lockdown now. The choice is being in lockdown now or having thousands more preventable deaths later. Neither are good choices but no one has the luxury of good choices anymore in a global disaster of this magnitude. That's the reality the world over and we need to adapt to this because if we don't _people will die_. 

Guys, we are in uncharted waters here. Every country on this planet will have to take _extreme_ measures to prevent massive loss of life. This is the defining disaster of our time. Even the 1918 pandemic or the world wars did not shut down the world like this has. We do not have history to learn from because this has _never happened before_.I've come back home after a fairly long time and have duly switched my parents' evening diet from Tez to NDTV. So now in have two senior citizens who're as heartbroken as I am from 9 to 10.

# Q. Why I'm against a re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat?

Let's start with this 1-minute clip from ""Shut up ya Kunal Episode 6 - Ravish Kumar""

1-minute clip: [https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD](https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD)

**Crowd manipulation** is the intentional use of techniques based on the principles of [crowd psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) to engage, control, or influence the desires of a crowd in order to direct its behavior toward a specific action.   This practice is common to religion, politics, and business and can facilitate the approval or disapproval or indifference to a person,  policy, or product.  

Sorry to say but I'm against every re-run or any show be it Ramayan or Circus starring Shah Rukh Khan. While you are busy watching these shows you will cry when Lord Ram is left stranded in a jungle and when his feet will hurt after walking so much but you won't pay attention that the poor are stranded on the roads and they have to walk hundreds of km without any food and they are crying because they know they are gonna die. People are accusing China of hiding the actual number of casualties, Well you have no idea what's coming your way. This is the reason why Supreme leader is coming daily and doing stupid live sessions to keep you engaged.

# Q. What's the psychology behind India-Pakistan and Nehru debates?

 Let me introduce you to ""BIG LIE"", A psychological trick.

Hitler's psychological profile:

>His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool  off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some  good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept  blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything  that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one;  and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later  believe it.

The above quote appears in the report, *A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend,* by [Walter C. Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charles_Langer) 

>Never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame;  concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that  goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political  whirlwind

This is why the Supreme leader never accepts a mistake and keeps pressing on Congress and specifically Congress for everything. IT cells never allows you to cool down. 

# The questions you should be asking: 

1. Why we are not ready to tackle COVID-19 when we had months to prepare? 
2. Why people are stranded on roads?
3. Why doctors don't have PPE kits?
4. Why permission to make COVID-19 test kits was given to a company from Gujrat instead of other 18 companies who claimed to manufacture these kits at a lower price.
5. Why Prime Minister missed the key points in his speech when he announced the Lockdown which created Panic in the country? 
6. Why they gave you only 3 hours to prepare for the lockdown why an immediate press conference was conducted? 
7. Why Centre allocates ₹20,000 crore to develop Lutyens’ Delhi amidst coronavirus crisis? 
8. Why we have not conducted enough tests? 
9. Why  Adityanath Govt Uses Epidemic Diseases Act to Arrest CAA Dissenter?
10. Why Dalits in Modi's constituency are eating grass in this lockdown? Why they don't have anything to eat?

374,Opinion of CAA from someone who avoids politics,20,eq0kr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eq0kr4/opinion_of_caa_from_someone_who_avoids_politics/,10,"The decision of the government to allow non-muslim foreign immigrants from neighbouring countries is the most important decision of the year after modi again rose to power in may 2019. There has been a lot of mystery surrounding the act and what its consequences and the worry for the muslim community further increases by the decision to maintain a national registry for which it seems necessary to prove your origin through documents which can be difficult for a lot of people.

A question arises that why the government felt it was necessary to implement such a clearly controversial decision. There was never a need for such a bill that invites immigrants from other countries and the modi government has previously never shown any interest in the hindus in the neighboring countries. So is the decision just a move towards making india a place reserved for just hindus by discriminating against the muslim community. As they couldn’t directly discriminate against the muslims on the basis of just religion as we claim to be a secular country and that would have been a direct war against the constitution so they decided to remove muslims exclusively from an important decision of the government which does not directly affect the common person of the country. So is this decision the first part of the plan of the modi government to radicalize the people to turn against the people of our own country just because they don’t follow the same religion as us. Is modi really such a petty thinker that he would waste the energy and resources of our nation to just push his Hindutva agenda instead of focusing on more important world issues at hand.

After the bill was silently introduced and quickly passed the government has been sitting in the back seat and are letting the events pan out as they can. The top level is not answering any questions and neither are raising new ones by acting as the decision is a good and fair and are letting the people of the country go up against one another. There has been a huge opposition to the act as any thinking person wouldn’t go up against the rights of other people just on small difference but the government has a lot of loyal followers who wouldn’t even dare to criticize the governments decision and the government expends a lot of energy to keep them on their side by circulating propaganda and diverting the issues so they are always in the good light.

But this just feels like the modi government is trying to rise in power and gain more control over the country and we can just wait for his next move and judge the true intention of the government whether it is power or just a more hindu state. So the next four years will be a fight between the common man vs the government and we can just hope that we have the will power to fight it to the end and have the sense to understand the plight that can fall on our fellow men if we fail to do so.",1579297654.0,"This is a totally respectable, yet one dimensional POV. Even if Modi’s true intentions aren’t that of creating a Hindu state (unlikely) the hatred has been spread. I’ve stopped counting the number of people I fight with on Twitter everyday, people who DEMAND a Hindu state. His true failure lies here. Unable to curb the hatred. Letting his own pets (Yogi and co) openly talk shit about his country’s minorities. 

Even if an argument is made that he isn’t the creator of the hatred, there shouldn’t be any doubt about him being the ENABLER of the hatred. He is a bad PM and is openly demeaning those who go against him by not even acknowledging them. Kahaan hai democracy?Your observations are correct but you're missing an important part of the puzzle, NRC. NRC has the potential to render a lot of Indians stateless (no voting rights) and that's when CAA comes into picture. From the stateless people all the non muslims would be given the Citizenship back applying CAA. So you'll have a lot of poor Muslims fighting for citizenship in court and we all know how long our court takes and during that time they won't be able to cast in their votes and voila you have a winning formula for BJP.

391,How deep does the hatred for Muslims go in Indian society?,270,fbvox4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbvox4/how_deep_does_the_hatred_for_muslims_go_in_indian/,175,"Met a hindu friend yesterday who runs a business in a small-town that has decent Muslim population (\~20%). He told me all the good things about how he has close Muslim friends. How he COMPULSARILY has to visit 3 of his friend's house for feast during Eid. How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

TLDR: Met a friend who has close Muslim friends but still hates muslims.",1583106022.0,"Welcome to reality bro.....History is rife with instances of minorities being hounded by the majority who doubt the minorities to be a fifth column.  

Several reasons accumulate together to build an edifice of hatred that nothing can break. India saw the worst blooodshed in this century because of some Muslims wanting a separate state. From that moment onwards the onus, unfortunately, fell on the Muslims who stayed back. While many, or almost all Muslims are patriots who are rooted to the soil of the country - they have time and again been let down by the less patriotic among them. The rise in Islamic fervour worldwide, starting from Grand mosque seige in Mecca, Iranian revolution, Mujaheddin war in Afghanistan - has again roused fear in not only Hindus but also others. The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, the repeated cross border attacks have added fuel to the fire. Identity politics that started in the late 1980s keeps many a party afloat. The party that plays on identity of religion has cashed in on the fractures based on identity. Indian secularism is not the ""laicite"" philosophy of the western world. Therefore lack of Uniform Civil Code is brought up frequently, though the present differences in civil code is innocuous. But is the mind intelligent enough the comprehend such nuances?

European countries who saw the meat grinding world wars have been circumspect in seeing that hatred never rises. But India, as a society, is all forgiving - of sexism, of corruption, of filth, of traffic violation, of casteism. It has been forgiving of the simmering religious hatred. 

I am in no way condoning the violence. But I am saying that the human mind is so fallible to hatred. Conformation bias strengthens the odium, and counter examples howsoever strong they may be, don't alleviate the bitterness.

Just like what The Great Depression did to the plight of the Jews. Just like what World War 1 did to the Christians in Turkey.",Politics

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

I worked in a company for three years while I was approached by the current one. They persuaded me a lot to join and casually agreed to work on my terms. Lately, I was pushed into leading the domain I didnt sign up for. I was hired as the head of business development in terms of building relations. However, I have been pushed into being sales head. Given this shift and constant salary delays, I have been meaning to quit but decided to give it a couple more months 

But what followed recently was a shocker when my HR out of nowhere calls and tells me that they dont want me to continue. I was extremely furious with management as they directly persuaded me but chose to tell me through HR without even intimating about any issue. 

Upon further discussion with my COO, it turns out that it wasn't my performance or work, which they thankfully are very content with. It was coworkers saying shit about me that led him to assume and believe that I am degrading the office culture which was a shocker to me. 


Few points on the topic - 

1. My colleagues came to me with a work problem in hysterical and stressed states. 

For ex, I feel underpaid and stuff. To which I gave the suggestion to compile the work and highlight your skills and then have a one on one meeting with hr and management to justify the raise. 

This was portrayed to my management as me trying to demotivate people and pushing them to ask for raise. 


2. My CEO asked my HR to validate. She never spoke to me and gave me the reason as performance based issues for firing. Further told my CEO that she has validated the same with everyone else in the company and based on this he decided to let me go. 


3. I am the last person to gossip and been very out front in terms of my opinions. 



Have a discussion with my CEO tomorrow. Can anyone shed some light on how to deal with this. He doesn't want me to leave in terms of work but doesn't want a ""negative source"" in his team.

415,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,8,dc6k28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,20,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.",1570027532.0,"They will probably start unfollowing you or whatever it's called. You would probably not be having a straightforward conversation at that with those who find it offensive.I don't think so , Indian hot celebrities already have pics like these.

418,What is prospect of photography in India?,10,dn1xda,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dn1xda/what_is_prospect_of_photography_in_india/,4,"I'm a bit above beginner photographer from Ahmedabad and I wish to pursue a career in Photography. I want to find out a few things and I guess India could help me:
1. What are prospects of business?
2. How good is this as a career for not just survivability but to thrive? (I don't want to live in a mansion but yeah in long term a life where I don't have to worry)
3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?",1572058302.0,"I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.
I wish you all the best :)[deleted]",Photography

Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime.It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography.Everyone is a photographer these days.

451,Visiting India,11,es78p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/,9,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",1579698430.0,"Hey, welcome to India. You don't have to worry about street photography in India because people will come to you for selfie for sure. 

You are coming at right time. The weather is good, you can enjoy the food. Go to food streets, Taj Mahal (drive in afternoon), gardens, historical sights, India gate and more. Feel free to msg if you need any more detailed info.Hi, Welcome to India! I hope you have a great trip here, apart from business.
As such, I do not think you would have issues doing street photography, people generally do not mind. If you think someone would mind, just let them know - and they will tell you if they don't want. I guess it would only be women being photographed that you need to worry about. Mostly, be careful of your gear in public to avoid something getting stolen.
Buildings can be photographed, as long as they are not government buildings, which may land you in a soup. Some historic places require separate tickets for professional photography, be sure to buy that. Also, if someone heckles you over rules, stand your ground. People do this for money, but don't mean to hurt.
Please be vigilant while you travel specially in public transport. 
In Delhi, Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jana Masjid, Akshardham are must visit. You can also do Agra for Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri. Jaipur is also a short distance from Delhi, with great forts to visit.Golden temple in Amritsar is also very good option. It maybe be best if you can take a local along. Tourist places can be mad crowded.
Visit old Delhi for street food delicacies. If this is your first visit, bring a strong stomach and the food will not disappoint you. I guarantee.
Let us know how it went. Enjoy!Welcome! 

It's completely okay to take pictures, and if you're not too shy, it's completely okay to dance like a maniac, roll on the streets, whatever. If you're comfortable around people different from you, people might even interact in funny ways, ask for pictures with you, stare, etc. etc.

It's going to be very crowded, possibly polluted. Very hot, unless it's within a month from now. 

Places are qutb minar, red fort, etc. etc. just try to be assertive so as to not get fleeced, and preferably go early morning to avoid the traffic, if it's not to hazy for your pictures.

You can't do anything disrespectful to them. only in temples, you have the be barefoot, sometimes cover your head, sometimes photography not allowed, but you will get to know about all that there itself. Beware of shoe stealers, pickpockets, all that jazz. Very common. And no need for the namaste's, they never happen.",Photography

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.",1557331956.0,"Don't know where you are from, sorry, but this field is really, really overbooked.

For me, a single photographer has no future in India, my best advice will be : make a team and join an elder. 

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS)Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well.Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

462,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2228,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.",1570136480.0,"We live in a societyIs the photographer Auditya of Audi photography by any chance ?I remember watching The Dark Knight in theater, it was mostly empty and my friends were kinda making fun of me for watching comic book movie.

If you are new to food photography, my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you haven't done this professionally, which is why you will work with them on pricing, so its fair for both parties. Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.

You make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.

*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer.

I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?  

",1448124820.0,"I don't see why it would be illegal in public. Under which section. 

It is not totally illegal to even record a conversation now on phone, how is taking a image in public place illegal?

As for your flower example, if it went to court i think the image could be analyzed and the law may side with you depending upon how the image comes out. Is the flower the main visual or was it the women. 
But even then unless the women's image was not vulgar it should not matter since its in public.  

This IPC Section about outraging the modesty of Women is a very ridiculous law. It can be brought into anything. It has no proper context, many a mundane situation can end up being labeled under it. Genuine question. Would love if someone can clear this up !Some times it entirely depends on the equipment you are carrying. Once I was at Marine Drive in Mumbai, where some wannabe photographers with their expensive DSLRs and tripods were taking some shots, as were others with cell phones and or touristy point and shoot cameras (mine). Down comes a police jeep with and swoops on their equipments, it was more like a scene from an anti-encroachment drive for street vendors. The guys tried to argue but they anyway drove away with their equipment. This all happened in under 2-3 minutes. I dunno what happened after that. But rest of us who were happily clicking were no even bothered by the cops. Now I don't know the legality of this, but surely it depends on the equipment you carry.

And this is not an isolated experience, even at other places carrying a DSLR raises a few eye-brows whereas  a simple point and shoot doesn't.

504,[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector.,10,d0jtpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0jtpf/career_advice_exploring_opportunity_in_it_sector/,8,"Hi fellow Indians. 

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start. 

If you are still reading, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking out time.",1567820098.0,"Hi, OP. Congratulations on persevering in your achievements. 

What do people in IT do? Write software. Where you need to be in order to be able to get into the industry is be able to do things:

1. Clear interviews
2. Write software 

\## Getting Interviews

Recruiters in the IT industry hire from :

1. colleges via campus recruitments
2. or from other companies - they look for prior experience. 
3. employee referrals 

Having no job title that says you are a developer and applying out of the blue will have your resume get silently rejected - you won't even hear a rejection from them. 

Since you're trying to crack into IT industry your best strategy is - put together some examples of you making software. Make pieces of software on somewhere like github and host it online. If you made a desktop application - put together a slideshow of the features of the application as a powerpoint presentation. If you made a web app. Put a live instance of it somewhere and link to it from your resume. 

Then get one of your friends or acquaintances who work in a IT company to refer you. Companies usually pay employees a bonus for a successful referral. So there is nothing to lose for this acquaintance and only some cool windfall if you make it. So they'll gladly refer you. A lot of people even refer people out of the blue on LinkedIn so that's possible too. 

If you apply directly to a company out of the blue with no prior experience - they'll just delete the email/resume. But there are some places where people overlook past job titles if the candidates seem to come across passionate - has made software in free time and has samples to show despite not having the background. These are fewer in number but they are there. Which entails that you have to get that first software developer title on your resume. You can't fake it. Employers have cornered labour in India by requiring a signed document from previous employers saying that so and so person has worked here for so and so years. 

\## Clearing Interviews 

1. I talk about these as two different things because they are, as things go in the industry, unfortunately parallel and sometimes even orthogonal skills depending on the organization you are trying to join. What I mean is - what an organization often tests you - the skills they look for when interviewing you are often quite theoretical - data structures, algorithms, big o notation. Those you can pick up with \[a book like this\]. That is literally the only book you will need to read and internalize to cover the theoretical aspects you need to master. Those people who went to 4 year CSE degrees? You've just levelled with them by reading this one book. Trust me. It's that good. And that is all they look for.  Read it cover to cover. BECOME that book. 

2. Then there is the practice of writing code. Not everything you encounter will be available in that book. Companies look for programming aptitude. Which means they will ask you to write programs like ""find the second largest number in a list of numbers"". You won't find them in any book. You will be able to apply your ability to code to make that program work.

3. Knowing a language properly. It is important that, when you are starting out, to know one thing properly. If you want to be a Java developer - show proficiency in using Java. This is knowledge - can you code in this specific toolset - do you demonstrate proficiency in a way that you can start delivering value from day one and not require any ""training""? 

In the process of clearing interviews, you will have learnt what you needed to write software to survive the job so you're set that way.You seem to have  Devops or Site Reliability Engineer hobbies. But you have experience in UI/UX design. Market obviously prefers experience. So you have those two choices to break into the IT industry.",Photography

506,Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?,78,bh942l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bh942l/why_do_people_spend_years_preparing_for_civil/,75,"A few months back I visited my friend who was preparing for civil service exams. The guy was preparing for the fourth consecutive year and I feel even this year he couldn't clear it so probably he would prepare again. It has been four years since we graduated from college and it is extremely difficult for me to understand how people can trade the prime years of there life for just preparing for an exam.

There is one thing called passion. I understand someone who is very passionate about say Programming, Photography, Acting etc and spends years trying to build a product, improve his photography or get a good acting role respectively. It is because these people probably are doing what they like and there is no better way of spending your 20s in my opinion. 

But preparing for civil services for such a long amount of time seems like a complete waste of time to me. People don't know what it is like to be an IAS/IPS/IES etc. They are spending so many years in their youth cramming for an exam without even knowing what it is like to be one of those things. And during this time most people have absolutely no life. I asked my friend about his daily routine and what he does on weekends etc and I was surprised how he could spend these years like that which were devoid of much human interaction, adventure, traveling, making money or doing anything that you would have good memories about down the line.

By the way, I am not questioning civil services or people preparing for that. There is nothing wrong with that. I am just asking why people continue doing it for so long when they fail the first one or two times when they don't even know if they'd like the actual job or not. I feel it is an utter waste of time even if you become an IAS after say your sixth attempt by which time you'd have spent six most prime years of your life doing absolutely nothing.",1556230386.0,"1. It's not that easy for most people to accept failure and move on. The more years you have put in, there is more of sunk cost fallacy at work. If you accept you can't cut it anymore, it's like accepting your last 4-5 yrs were a waste. Disclosing it to parents and relatives is tougher.

2. As the years go down the drain, it becomes more difficult to do something else. Jobs aren't readily available, you can't do masters, can't really expect to do an MBA from a top 20 college unless you have stellar acads and manage a 99.8+ percentile.
Your only true options are SSC or Bank exams, which are a massive step down and difficult for most to accept.

3. And the biggest of them all, laziness. Both of the above points can be overcome if you're honest to yourself and are willing to move out of your comfort zones, but the laziness inside most prevents them from doing that.1. For fair curvy chick in marriage

510,[SERIOUS] I am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next. I am genuinely lost.,19,cm92t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm92t0/serious_i_am_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use/,8,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

&#x200B;

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

&#x200B;

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

&#x200B;

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

&#x200B;

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.  


Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",1565028279.0,"I am a graphic designer too, and I can relate to that thing you said where you started hating designing casually because of your job. I have come to that point that nowadays I am like why put so much thought into this, just get it over with. About your mentor talking about not studying, he is partly right in a sense that you will mostly learn about software and shit more in institutes in India. But I have heard top colleges like NID and all actually helps you improve, but dunno how exactly.

I am also in a very similar boat as you where I would just want to get over with the work that is assigned to me without thinking much and shit. I realized this follow your passion route is pointless when you have no proper passion only. One of my friends who is as passionless as me is working as a UI/UX designer at McKinsey in Chennai. His work is truly pathetic for someone of his experience, but he gets paid some 2 to 3 times more than me, has fixed hours and weekends off. I was thinking of taking that job up because like you, I don't care about passion and all anymore. But right now, I cannot make a move to Chennai so that's out.

Hope you find a solution to this issue.A graphic designer here. My 2nd job now, in one of biggest automobile industries in world.

I get you, I completely get you how you've been bored by your job. But it can be said about any other job.

**Graphic design is tough.**

If you're in ad agency, you're fucked. They pay a lot but your timings will be **almost** 11 hours work excluding travelling. I'm talking about proper ad agency who works for big brands.

> What types of jobs do professional photographers get into?

Weddings. If he enjoys it, there is a lot of money to be made in India. Prices for an experienced photographer range from 2-8 lakh per wedding (4 events) in Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't even for the top photographers. For someone with my experience, there is more money in Delhi, than London!

There is also even photography (corporate), and then there are regular portraits, headshots, model portfolios etc. These are like the bread and butter in the off season. Maternity and baby photography is taking off in India. Not as highly paid yet, but still around 15-20K for around a 3 hour shoot. This has a lot of potential.

There are other options like real estate and architectural photography. Lower end is not worth it, but if start getting corporate gigs, that's very well paid.

There are so many others, like product and food photography. Each is different and requires a different skill set/way of thinking. I think I am pretty bad with food. 

> Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

How long has he been photographing for? Cheapest DSLR, probably a Nikon D3XXX (whichever number is current), and a 35mm prime lens (can buy used for around 5K). You can even look at a second hand camera, as long as it is in a good condition. In my opinion, you don't get enough for your money by upgrading amongst the low end cameras, so you'd rather get the cheapest and use the spare money for other gear - this helps more than, say, buying a D5XXX. Depending on what he wants to photograph, he will need a flash (look for Yongnuo - and quite okay). 

Good luck!

I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

Work life balance and 4. so that I can work o my hobbies viz ekectric guitar, photography and travelling

The government exams which I think tick the boxes for me is IAS, solely ( Though I will sacrifice my hobbies for that obviously as the responsibility would be much greater in magnitude). The backups which I think would work well are

1. UPSC CSE( IRS , specifically because it is all in all a desk job in my estimation, also is a great backup if I attemp the CSE again the subsequent year)
2. UPSC IFoS, for obvious reasons
3. SSC CGL( I have heard ministry of external affairs department has a few desk jobs. Also, ASO)
4. RBI Grade B, I heard that bank exams are mostly riddled with casteist policies such as late promotions and the like

What do you suggest? I have an aptitude for the social science subjects in general and psychology, philosophy in particular.

Or planning to start? ,13,i09qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/i09qb/anyone_else_into_film_photography_or_planning_to/,52,"Since everyone with a digital camera is now a photographer, to be a true hipster you have to be different and shoot retro-looking, dark-cornered, color-faded photos with applications like Hipstamatic and such. 

However, you can take your hipsterishness to new levels and start shooting real film and develop it yourself. The equipment is cheap, film is not. There's plenty of places you can get the film developed/scanned, and if you plan to develop it yourself, you can still get chemicals (although the choice is getting more and more limited). 

Black and White photography is more fun. The results are different from your average digi shots (even with your digicam's Black and White setting) and it's easy to develop at home. And the photos look great.. More dramatic. 

Color film (Negatives) will still get you better shots than your point and shoot, but since you're not instant feedback you never know if you got the shot or not (This holds a certain appeal to people - The waiting part). 

Then you have Color Slide Film which is tougher to shoot than film (harder to get exposure right), but the colors and sharpness is insane and you get to see the photos right there on the strip (Negatives are, well, negatives). 

[Here are some black and white photos I shot](http://flyyoufools.imgur.com/bw_photos)

[And these are some shot on Velvia Color Slide film](http://flyyoufools.imgur.com/color_slides)

Fun Activity: Dig out the old film camera in your house, buy some Kodak Gold film (Rs100) and shoot around. Punch yourself everytime you look at the camera's back after taking a shot.

535,Reddit India Recap of 2018,211,ab62uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ab62uu/reddit_india_recap_of_2018/,27,"Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.  

* [Hindustan pencils responding to a request by a mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7k0muz/a_mother_wrote_to_hindustan_pencils_about_her/) sends special sharpeners created to be used by left-handed people with ease.

* [India and Pakistan bond over ](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8f0jig/pakistani_friend_of_mine_tried_a_lays_indias/) the flavour of Lay's India Magic Masala

* [Section 377 gets scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dfine/gay_sex_has_been_decriminalised_in_india_the/) and gay sex gets decriminalized after one of the longest legal battles in Indian history and \#LoveWins.  
And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year. 

* Among the many historical posts, r/india particularly loved the pictures of [three women training to be doctors (1885)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mczx1/an_indian_woman_a_japanese_woman_and_a_syrian/),  [historical photos of Bhagat Singh posted on the day of his death anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86h70i/87_years_ago_today_shaheed_bhagat_singh_was/),  a [smog-free New Delhi from the 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wow0r/new_delhi_in_1950s_clean_air_without_smog/), [a French boy introducing himself to Indian soldiers during the First World War](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x16j8/a_french_boy_introduces_himself_to_indian/) and [Prof. C.V Raman teaching in 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9d7nxf/1960s_physicist_cvraman_teaching_in_class/).

* **Art:** We got lots of great original art this year.

Please note there have been hundreds of amazing posts I haven't been able to list partially due to practicality, and partially due to character limits. But, just because it isn't here doesn't mean your post was not amazing. :P

This year I made a resolution that I will learn something new any chance I get. I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses. 

  
 STUDENTS PILOT’S LICENCE (SPL)

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math’s.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.   


Any suggestions/advice will be much appreciated.   


Regards,",1566134203.0,"Before you get into the details, Go to a doctor and check if you are first medically fit to be a pilot. There are a lot of requirements when it comes to height, physical appearance and even the size of your eye balls. I simply got rejected from flight school because one of my eye balls was bigger in size than the other. Once you get that sorted. You need to complete physics and math as it is a prime requirement in flight school. Most flight schools for flying commercial has classes to do with physics and math. Hope this helps.

>Photoshop

For photoshop look for the channel 'Piximperfect' to learn basics such as masking, layers, blending modes etc. Other channel- Photoshop Tutorials

If you're good in photoshop, premiere isn't gonna be tough for you. [Here is a beginner video](https://youtu.be/Hls3Tp7JS8E) 

Also note that there are two versions of premiere : Adobe premiere pro and premiere elements. 

>music production

For music production, choose a DAW and don't change. Stick with it until you get basics right. Most of the stuff you can learn on YouTube itself.
My preference is Ableton Live. But you can go for Audacity(free), Fl Studio, Cubase etc.

Unfortunately both of these things are very costly. DAWs are super expensive.

Edit: Gimp is a free alternative of Photoshop. If you want to learn about Data Analytics - Machine Learning - AI - all those terms you keep hearing about. Here's a really good track, that's free - all that's needed is time,patience and will to learn.

543,does it ever happen to you? I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,6,bykzgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykzgg/does_it_ever_happen_to_you_i_get_obsessed_about/,5,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats. 

Does this happen with any of you here?",1560120784.0,"Interested in selling any of those ?It's good that you are trying to find what interests you but clearly none of the things you mentioned could help.

544,I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost.,8,cm8zqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm8zqf/im_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use_some/,1,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",1565027658.0,I see there's no reply here. Please try posting on r/indian_academia or just go through posts about career guidance by searching the whole sub reddit. Good luck OP,Photography

Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval.

559,Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;",1548813778.0,"Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage. * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!

4. Camera as per Geekyranjit is okay for the price.

Works perfect. Has a 8GB memory card and stores last 4 hours of video I guess. I leave my car in the hot Sun and the camera seems to work just fine. Has a very wide almost 170 degree viewing angle. The battery backup lasts just for 10 seconds allowing the camera to shut itself down properly when disconnected. I leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. Got a splitter for the lighter socket so I have one more slot for charging my mobile when needed.

**My college sucks. I’ll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**

Firstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. 

I do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java/Android and Swift/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. 

For web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML/CSS/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.

My recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React/Vue/Angular) or Android/Java or iOS/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android/Java and iOS/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. 

Now you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.

Its important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for ""app ideas"".

**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**

This is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . 

Here you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.

**Certifications? Yay or nay?**

**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. 

**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**

There is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).

**Can I work with you?**

I should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =). ",1503604093.0,"> And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually.

this. read the papers you signed when you joined your current company.It's standard practice among employers to include a clause that forbids you from moonlighting. So in all likelihood, your company should have that too. Ultimately, it depends on how cool they are with you doing a side business (provided they come to know). 

Almost everyone makes secondary income from equities, real estate, etc. and companies don't bother about that. But whatever you do, make sure you do not use any company resources (including office hours). Do it in somebody else's name.

I've not studied much my entire life, as I was able to manage upto 10th without having to study. 11th was a huge kick in the ass for me - but I've learnt nothing and have still not started studying. 


I've been thoroughly incapacitated by depression- which I've had for about five years now- and cannot hold a routine for shit. I'm taking therapy and medication, but depression isn't the only issue apparently, anxiety is a huge problem too. While the suicidal thoughts did recede for a while, they're coming back now, because of how big and final the board exams feel. I know I am going to fuck it up. I probably won't fail it, but anything below 90% is insignificant for OC anyway (I think).

So many people are helping me, yet I've done nothing but disappoint. Doesn't help that my family is filled with over-achievers. I am emotionally drained and exhausted. If I have to redo this year, I'd rather drop out or kill myself. What do I do now? What does a guy who fucks up his education do? I do shitty photography, and play shitty guitar. I am not good enough at either of them for it to be of any significance. I don't know if I will ever be able to push myself to actually study, because that's something I've been fooling myself with for the last year.


I have a practice practical exam tomorrow, and have not started shit for it. Fucked up every other revision exam. Every exam this year has been a disaster.

What can I do?
",1517184874.0,"I'm also a class 12 student like you. For studies I would say ignore all the other books now. Ask your friends for an Oswaal chapterwise question bank (it costs 150 rs each and you get all subjects). Study every single question in that and I guarantee that you'll get a very good score (those books are my lifeline). If you can,try to get your parents to buy the Oswal book for your stream which has all previous year question papers of all subjects (it costs 500 rupees). The chapterwise books will help you to get familiarised with the shit in each chapter and the big book with previous year papers will help you understand how board questions are asked.
About practical exam I too have it tomorrow and I haven't opened my book (It's the model practicals right? .You don't have to worry much. It's designed to be a help for the poor performing students and the teacher in your school and the external examiner has an arrangement between them on how much marks to be given. 
I suppose you have written 2 model exams by now. The first one was supposed to be the easy one and second is supposed to be the hardest ever. Your boards won't be like any of them ( not too easy not too hard). 

If you are in a relationship or trying to find someone to fuck then forget about it for now. You already have so much stress and all the shit associated with a teen romance is not worth your time now. I myself only study some 1 hr a day but howmuch study time you require varies from person to person. 

While avoiding relationship shit is a good idea,never ditch your friends. Call someone everyother day and talk. Or go out on Sundays and eat or something. It has a very good effect on your mind.

Please ask me if you want to know anything more.

588,Its becoming hard/Impossible to find good CS jobs in India.,104,6v9vtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6v9vtx/its_becoming_hardimpossible_to_find_good_cs_jobs/,42,"But unlike some people, I am willing to dedicate more of my resources and skills to find the right fit.

Why can't employers do the same?

Edit: Some questions I read.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

I like CS actually.

> What are your qualifications ? Where's your GitHub link ? At onr end of the spectrum you have Google paying upwards of a crore per annum to people from IISc. At the other end you have people working as game testers for 10000₹ per month.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

I'm in a very weird situation in life right now and could use some advice. Please be honest. I'll give you a little background about myself without trying to dox me. I am a 25-year-old graphic designer by profession. I graduated from an average college in 2013 with a degree in Journalism (one of the biggest mistakes of my life, especially in terms of the three years I lost). After graduating from college, I was in a tough financial situation, so I had to immediately get a job to support myself. Since I knew the basics of photoshop, I just applied for a job as a graphic designer with an agency and got it. I worked there for 8 months, and quit due to deteriorating mental health. After that, I spent about a year and a half battling that mental condition, which still affects me, and again, got a job as a graphic designer at a startup, due to financial strain. I worked at that job for 6 months (till the company closed down) and then got my current job, which I have been working at for around 1.5 years, again, because I have no other skills. Now, in this 1.5 years + 6 months, is where I properly learned the tools of design and got some idea of how the industry works on the design front. Again, I never had any ambition in this field, I just got into because I had no other skills.

Another thing about my ""career""; Since I said, I took this job out of desperation, I'll be honest with you about my skills. Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design. I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme. I have come across some seriously talented and dedicated designers and sometimes feels ashamed of myself on how I work. Also, I am not terrible at what I do. I am pretty decent. Especially when I put my heart to it. But over the last few months, my mental issues, lack of confidence and general bleak outlook on life has made my job harder.

Now, I feel, that this job has reached a plateau phase and I have to do something better with my life. I was wondering if I should enroll in National Institute of Design's Graphic Design Post Graduate program. I don't know if it will actually help me learn or improve my life and job prospects in any way, but so far, whatever I do, I learned on the job.

Now some other details. Right now, I get paid 30K a month out of which, if I live an absolutely frugal lifestyle (no eating out in fancy places, no beer, no trips, no shopping), I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum. I am talking about in terms of savings. If I do plan to enroll, I will only be able to in the 2019-2021 Batch. I feel I will need a year to start properly saving up, get loans, writing all the entrance exams and preparing myself.

Now here are my other concerns. When I look at this roadmap, I will be ""job ready"" only by the age of 29. Which is a very scary thought for me, because I will be sorta back to square one. Another major issue for me is, even though my life is quite bleak, one of the few things in life that keep me going is the woman I love. She is not the kind who will ever pressurize me into marriage (even though her parents will) and she told me, if I am serious about this, she will convince them to wait for me to finish graduating.

I want to know, is this sudden jump worth the risk? Honestly speaking, I feel very depressed and quite often suicidal because of the mediocre life I have led so far, and nothing seems like a happy ending to me. Even thinking of this move, has taken a huge toll on my already deteriorating mental health. I am talking about if this will help me long term in terms of career opportunities. I don't aim to slack off and ""party"" through college if I get in. I am willing to slog to the point of death if this will actually help me.

What would really help me, other than general advice is, if anyone has studied in NID, they could tell me if the course is worth my time and money. Will I actually learn something there? Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that. Also, if you do know anyone who studied there, could you please link them to this post, or just ask them?

**Edit:** Hey guys. Sorry, I just saw the post now. Wasn't feeling to well and just wen't to bed after posting. First of all, thanks for taking your time and talking to me. I am sorry that I didn't state much of my technical knowledge and the source of motivation for me to even look up NID.

**Source of motivation:** So, like I mentioned above, I got into design because I HAD to get a job, and the only bankable skill I had was how to use photoshop. Everything else, I learnt on the job, mostly through trial and error. I started feeling a course in design would help me because it will give me a more structured approach into working.  A better understanding of layouts, colors, what works, what doesn't. Honestly, one of the biggest drawbacks I have is, convincing the client of the final design. Like, even when I present it to them, I do it with this weird look showing a huge lack in confidence, and that usually lets them ask me for multiple changes or with them saying they are not happy with the design. The current job I am working at, my boss is my friend from college, and he encourages me a lot to work without thinking of these things, but in the end, when I interact with the clients, this still happens. They say, yeah, the design is okay. Could we have another iteration? My friend is the one who convinces them into accepting the design saying a lot of business jargon. Bottom line is, I always see my work as mediocre and cannot accept it as what it is. I know, a Degree from NID won't immediately have an impact in my thought process, but I fell, I can at least support my self by saying, I do have an idea of what I want to do.

Another question I came across a few times with the answers you people wrote were whether I am looking to study for a bump up in the salary? My answer is primarily no. Yes, overtime I would love a nice paying job, but right now, it's more of me to learn something, because everything I do right now is from looking at other peoples works. I don't know how correct I am when I say this, but I feel that a degree from NID will add that prestigious college stamp, and help me get better opportunities and a better network too. And and some weight to me, mentally, in terms of confidence.

Technical Knowledge and hobbies - Adobe Illustrator (most proficient in this), Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Hobbies - Photography (very amateur). I can write a bit of content too. But it's not something I would market.

Another weird point (I don't know if it's relevant) is, I am quite well versed in pop culture and ""western culture"" of sorts. The reason I am bringing this up is, I use this as a major influence when I work in terms of design. Many menus and interior decor designs I did for my clients (which they loved), were inspired from this and they said it looks and feels much different from boring things they usually see elsewhere. I mean, it's not a huge skill. Lot of people nowadays are more ""globalized"" and dazzle people with one liners from TV shows and all in their designs, but I just mentioned this, because the agency I work for got a lot of praise from these ""out-of-box-for-india"" style work.",1511837525.0,"Considering you already have a job as a designer, what makes you want to enroll in the PG course? Is it because you feel you'll improve? I think you ought to ask yourself if your heart is truly in this line of work. If it is, then I truly believe that there's no better education than vocation. Keep at it. Learn from your seniors and talented designers around you. Read books about it. Research it online. Do everything you can to build your portfolio. 30k for a year and a half's experience isn't bad. But yes, at 25, it might not feel like much. I think part of moving on is to accept that you've lost 3 years of your life. Just use it as motivation to get better, faster.You are not living a mediocre life. Earning more than 30k can be improved certainly, but is no reason to get suicidal. I'd strongly suggest to be patient with your career. Each one of us has a long way to go.I have worked as a designer in my early days and still dabble with it in my spare time. Now, I haven't gone to NID, but here goes.

> Design doesn't come naturally to me

* I assure you, the designers whose work you're impressed by, aren't natural born designers. It just takes a lot of time and effort. And btw, I go through the same thing in my field. Some people are just so goddamn good that you wonder if you can ever be at their level. I believe I can, and so should you. It just takes persistence.

* Join a design community like http://dribbble.com/ so that you can interact with other designers, get criticism, share your work, etc. subscribe to http://www.creativebloq.com/ and Chris Spooner https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/ among others for regular inspiration.
* Have a very simple personal website. Create a name / brand for yourself online.

Those are the basics. Now for career:

* As a general rule, I'm biased against ""studying design in a college"" per se. I have a feeling that if you were making more money, you wouldn't consider this either, am I right?
* To be honest about the salary, 30k seems pretty low. I've known designers to make between 50k - 1L easily. At an experience level of ~4-6 years. If you're really good and are able to make it as a creative director (generally > 10 years xp) for the company, there's a ton of money involved.
* You did not mention your skill profile. I'll assume Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Fairly decent, but you need to diversify. There are multiple routes:
  * Art. You need to learn how to draw. You can combine digital art with design in many interesting ways. It is an excellent complement to design skills. Check out https://www.ctrlpaint.com/.
  * 3d modelling. Similar to the above. Check out http://blender.org/
  * Marketing. In the era of social media marketing, design and marketing have a close relationship. If you can brand yourself as a designer with a good grounding in marketing, more doors open up. If you're a total newbie, start here: https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/certification

There's a lot more to be said, but I hope this can get you started! Good luck :)",Photography

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

606,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",11,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",1555360902.0,"Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",1548078786.0,"It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward.India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory.Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong. ",AskIndia
613,What is 'Gotra'?,36,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,32,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",1543864935.0,"In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen. ",AskIndia
614,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,57,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",1555627392.0,"You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close)I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place!I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol)",AskIndia

617,We really need to talk about Flairs.,109,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not?

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview.

Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job.

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

629,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,43,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought......Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

631,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,2,7zckca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7zckca/well_articulated_anti_congress_whatsapp_forward/,5,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them?

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims.

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?

632,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,80,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,234,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",1437005483.0,"Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki. [deleted]>No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no?

633,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",34,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right?",AskIndia
634,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",10,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",1467222673.0,">Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage.I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again? > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision.",AskIndia

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Yeah and not just the subreddit. For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote. Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

651,The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,17,25ix5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ix5m/the_long_and_fascinating_story_of_how_dadra_and/,2,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

College was the trigger for me I had zero liking for the course and at the same time didn't really have any interest at all which I could pursue instead. So I dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at all.

Initially I went through that phase where I punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers. But I never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my NEET status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while, when things went South, I wished I had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times. 

I've been always been pretty bad at socialising. Once I went into the NEET lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it, it worsened the matter. I stopped keeping in touch with the few friends I had from school. I felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there wasn't much to converse about. Made a few friends online but the came and went.

665,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",11,fkql7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkql7h/askindia_fathersmothers_of_reddit_india_what_were/,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",1584571392.0,"OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well.https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural.1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

681,[AskIndia] How close do you think we are to getting stuck in the Middle Income trap?,21,esporu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/esporu/askindia_how_close_do_you_think_we_are_to_getting/,21,"I dont have anything to add but the question. 

But does India have what is needed to move to becoming a high income country? Any information and discussion will be appreciated.",1579792678.0,"A high income country is one where gross national income per capita is more than $12,000.

The main challenges to getting this done is twofold:

1) Population. With such a large population, $12k per capita means 12k * 1.2 billion = $14 trillion economy in terms of income alone. By way of comparison, most economists think that getting to a $5 trillion economy will be a challenge given current economic conditions.

2) Skill. High income countries tend to have skilled manufacturing and services as a large proportion of their income earning population. India has technology* but it’s not as widespread as a proportion of the population.

Also having a high proportion of skilled industries and workers requires really good primary, secondary and tertiary education. India has historically under-invested in primary and secondary education and chosen to focus on highly selective tertiary education — the IITs and the IIMs, etc. This leads to great outcomes for the few who get into those but it doesn’t move the needle in terms of national income stats.

\* Many will argue that India does very little cutting edge work here, instead focusing on subcontracting for MNCs or replicating business models proven abroad. But I’m ignoring that for the purposes of this discussion.We are bound to be in the Middle-Income trap and there is nothing this or any other government can do?

Our women LFPR (labor force participation rate) is around 30% whereas we should be in high 60-70s at least. But the problem is while women LFPR increased due to families wanting additional income to get out of poverty, as soon as income of family increases, LFPR decreases - i.e. women participation in labor is temporary to supplant additional income on a temporary basis. This is a recipe for a middle-income trap.

This is an excellent research paper on the same - very revealing

Let's brainstorm on the solution

I can only think of two possible solutions:

&#x200B;

1. Limit government officials carrying cash per day to 2000, unless they can show legitimate proof, ACB can raid them and seize all unaccounted cash.
2. Nobody may pass above act, what we can do is take snapshot of all 500/-, 1000/- 2000/- notes while going out of home and if forced to bribe for no benefit, post snapshot of those notes and officer's name and location",1579371875.0,"I think the AAP gov. has a whatsapp number where people can send videos of officials demanding bribes. I think something along those lines can be done. If one suspects that an official might demand a bribe then record them knowingly/unknowingly. For instance, always record the police officer who comes at your place for passport verification. Make it known from the get-go that you're recording. I reckon he won't dare ask for a bribe then.Your Both solutions are appreciable but have certain flaws.
The first one is simply arbitrary, unreasonable and you can't go against a person who has been hiding all the money all this long. Plus the ACB raid part is the biggest flaw coz both the parties will collude and bribe and consolidate each other.

The second one is again a very tiresome and could be easily misused an official who is rightfully doing his duty. Moreover reporting is not enough. People still report. Some even do sting operation and provide whole videos as evidence but the officials with their incredible influence and power simply escape any retribution.

Now for the solution part - As much as I understand as a Son of an IPS Officer and having seen this class of people for almost my whole life, the sole reason insufficiency.
You can't expect the top Bureaucrats who collectively run and maintain the whole nation on a small salary of 1 Lakh or so or sometimes even lesser.
What I mean is that they surely need much much more for the kind of life they aspire to live after qualifying the toughest exams and service they give to the nation. 

So basically the best stratagem would be to increase their Pay( In a reasonable but also sufficient for that class) and give them better services so that they don't have to that on the individual level (which everyone knows how they do that).

And Lastly trust me most of them don't even consider it a wrong coz they are just using the loopholes of law to benefit themselves (coz they are being treated really unfairly). And honestly I find their idea not very wrong(Don't get me wrong). I surely could be Biased.",AskIndia

According to RBI's guidelines, the liability falls on your bank if the fault is of 3rd Party that is neither you nor the bank, but only if you inform within 3 days. So, if it's not your fault then it doesn't matter what the manager has to say about recovery. If they can't, then also they will have to bear the burden.

For your reference, point 6(ii) in attached pdf

Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic ... - RBI PDF

https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI15D620D2C4D2CA4A33AABC928CA6204B19.PDF

>Third party breach where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system, and the customer notifies the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank regarding the unauthorised transaction.

Were those withdrawals cash withdrawals? If yes, then you have a stronger case because the card was with you and thus fault must lie within the system/bank.

Also point 9 and point 12 are extremely important-

>9) On being notified by the customer, the bank shall credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer’s account within 10 working days from the date of such notification by the customer (without waiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any).

Burden of proof.

>12) The burden of proving customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions shall lie on the bank.

My opinion: You must inform everything to the bank in writing and you must get a receiving. After doing this, you should ask them for the resolution. If the resolution offered by them is not optimal for you, then you should show the bank RBI guidelines and put pressure on them.Which bank is this? Has he used the card or account online?",AskIndia

Here are the things I've heard gym trainers say in a couple of cities in India (translated).

""You won't gain weight now. It's summer, you will sweat too much to gain weight.""

""You don't need to do warm-ups dude. Just lift."" (This guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in a sling. Kya hua? Dislocate ho gaya)

I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck!I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter.The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance.",AskIndia

1) Cash flow is everything. An accounting profit without cash flow is insignificant. Once your business is large enough you can even have banks deploy vendor/customer financing programs. There are startups who do this too now as well as receivables factoring exchanges (RXIL through TReDs) In India, it is not demand that creates cash, but rather cash that creates demand

2) Keep in mind in a lot of cases, the buyer is different from the user is different from the payer. Draw a people chart and plot what each persons motivations are and what you need to do to get the nod from each.

3) You are not your customer. Don't assume you know anything about your customer. This is why feedback loops are so important - they deliver both implicit and explicit feedback about the customer and how you should iterate your product and business. Invest heavily in feedback loops and make sure you're drawing intelligent insight from them. 

4) Don't be afraid of giant players. Big players are slow, have limited flexibility and capacity for change, have fixed cost structures and business models and do in fact leave plenty of room on the table for smaller players to operate. 

5) Contrary to what you may think, the best product does not always win. Marketing, branding, and sales is crucial. Don't ignore this just because you have an amazing product.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",1571163930.0,"I remember, in the early 90s, my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company. It took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxes.

When he finally got to the stage of producing toys, he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up (He had taken loans for machinery, which lay idle for a year, as he could not get permissions for manufacturing). When he finally started, he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt. 

But then, if you remember, extremely cheap Chinese toys flooded the market (post-liberalization) and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the company.

All because of red tapism.

This relates to point 5 of yours.I believe it has to do more with the Indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such. 

Indian capitalists such as Nirav Modi and Ramalinga Raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities. Sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as Enron scandal. But Indian businesses are too profit oriented, they treat their customers like shit. Before the entry of MNC in India, many Indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged, they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware. I still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy, they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us, I went to the same shop this year, they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise. 

MNCs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these Indian capitalists add to the fact the MNCs remind them about East India company from our history text books. 

When the Indian businesses change their shitty outlook, Indians would start trusting them.Wtf....you cited Ambani and Adani as having no competition. Are you real?

 A lot of people buy fancy guitars planning to become the next guitar god, practice 3 weeks and quit.  so there are often many bargains available second hand.

that said you need to find someone experienced to  make sure your purchase is not flawed.Go to Facebook groups - AM Used Musical Instruments & Gear or MM Used Musical Instruments and check out the listings there. Some great deals come there from time to time and it’s a well-moderated group with mostly trustworthy people.

Second hand is the way to go on your budget. Common misconception is that acoustics are meant to be cheap and electrics are meant to be expensive but a cheap acoustic plays like shit and sounds like shit so definitely stay away from brands like Juarez, Intern etc that you see on amazon. They will kill your enthusiasm in weeks, even though the deals might seem like a steal.

For 5000, I’d look for a Yamaha F310 or FS100C (quite common on the used market and really solid beginner and intermediate guitars). Yamaha makes great instruments at all prices. Also definitely spend a little more and get a setup from a guitar shop along with fresh new strings (even better if the seller does it for you). It’ll go a long way in improving your experience. Good luck!Acoustic guitars can be Steel strings or nylon strings. Steel strings are the toughest to play, nylon strings are the easiest. But the styles are also somewhat different. Finger picking for nylon strings and plectrum for Steel. 

 Granada, Yamaha, are the better companies but good models from Pluto, etc. should do. ₹5000 is the lowest price you will find them, so go second hand from olx etc.

From what I understand based on armchair research: 
Motivation to immigrate: better future life for children in terms of clean water, air, education
Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism? 

Experienced immigrants/ those who are in similar shoes, please share your thoughts",1561381878.0,"NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions.I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all. The world doesn't need to know I employed an investigator to collect evidence, legal or not.",1551563142.0,"[deleted]Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            

First things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       
      
Now, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      
      
This are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      
      
If you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        
      
Most importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work. ",AskIndia

748,[AskIndia] Is there an Indian equivalent of Hikikomori taking place in our society?,269,a7m150,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7m150/askindia_is_there_an_indian_equivalent_of/,129,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

Pillion has to be comfortable.

Any advice would be appreciated!!",1560028077.0,"*""Budget- Up to 1.6 Lakh""*  
Did you specifically wrote that number for Randians?  


Also, Buy Dominar.Try Jawa. Waiting period is long though.Have you considered the Dominar? Will require stretching your budget by 30k though. A tourer's dream.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

Thanks!!! 🙏",1562680535.0,"Pvt Ltd or LLP are indeed better than OPC, but if you're solo and don't want to involve anyone, it's better to go with OPC than a Proprietorship. In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.

OPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. 

You're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.

Also, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things.Few of my inputs

1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.
2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.
3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you just want to make a web based product, do as proprietorship. Unless you start earning 5-10 lakhs a year, its useless to get involved in legal stuff.",AskIndia

Edit: I am not seeking any advice here, I just want everyone to share their routines and spark a discussion so that people can ask questions to each other and learn. 

",1550102853.0,"I didn't realize the importance of deiting till I got into medschool.

Some tips:

 -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.
Soya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. 


- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. 


-  Exercise? 

 I do warm up first followed by

 500 skips (60fast 40slow)

 70 burpees

 100 push ups 

They can be divided in sets of 3

 Abs workout

 
 And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)


- If you swim after that it's a bonus.

Try reading about High Intensity Interval training. 

- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. 


- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)

Have patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages.

Before anybody comments shit instead of discussion, 

A) I'm a 5th Generation Maharashtrian (that I know of) and 3rd Generation Mumbaikar aged 41. So obviously I'm not a Muslim or a Pakistani posting here. Its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his Nationalism for any freeminded discussion. We all let it happen, it's our fault not of Bhakts.

B) Not a Dalit but a Chitpavan Brahmanvad, so I can claim My Hinduism to any Hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off, in real world. I'll show my clout and power to those, if and when need arises. Because that's not relevant here and i'm just clearing this for stupid and ignorant Bhakts.

Now, since that part is cleared, I definitely am not a supporter or a fan of Dawood or his chain of gangsters ever. Dawood was just a name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late 80s and 90s. Everyone as a kid used to mock himself as Bhai or Dawood gang leader just for fun. That was the kind of cult Dawood had in his prime, the mumbai underworld king. Look at any big international gangsters stories and Dawood was no different. From actors to politicians, businessmen and builders, Gold and Diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of India was affiliated with Dawood once directly or indirectly. During that period, only the Law enforcement and Cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave a fuck about it, like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or Pakistan or wherever he can easily travel.

I'm positive that he had hands on Mumbai serial blasts, everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos. But that's that. Finito. No hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it's obvious he didn't plant those bombs himself. His minions did. And those minions of his used some 3rd party to do the dirty work, similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag. So one cannot even prove that it links to Dawood based on hard evidence. There is none. It's only a feeling that we think Dawood did it. No matter how much We as citizens believe that he did it, our Judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go Scott free. Because it happened 25 years ago. Ofcourse Dawood will not come down and will confess, not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too. Because even his enemies hates cops and law and order. A common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at Bay. So nobody will ever come out and will be a witness. Chotta Rajan? Hahaha....he was once a part of Dawood gang, so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well. To be honest, he is no good use to the courts as he himself is a criminal with so many cases against him.

Ofcourse he has knowledge of Dawood a whereabouts, but how much really does he know since 5 years have passed and Dawood is still nowhere to be traced. Even if he is located, how will anybody bring him to India? And even if he is nabbed, what will be the charges? How will he be put behind bars cuz so far not a single chargesheet has been made against him, criminal or otherwise. He is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians, actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against Dawood, it will all be linked to them, one or the other ways.

So how is he a Terrorist, Criminal and Most Wanted? When in reality nobody wants him in India or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets. Which current politician wants that? Why would these Rich people wants a noose on their neck to bring Dawood back? To end Terrorism for good, these Rich people will sacrifice their 29 years ""good"" image?

Another thing is, what Dawood did back then, is the very same Sadhvi Pragya was charged for. Serial blasts that is. Now she is in Modi government. Because the Lawyers got her out. Because it's Lawyers job to defend. And they won't do the same for Dawood if the price is right? So it is safe to say Dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to India, he will get out Scott free. It's only that the BJP has put an image that since he is a Muslim and is in Pakistan so he is a Terrorist. What they will never say is , Dawood is a free man in India even today but if Dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets, no politicians, Actors, Actresses, Businessmen images will be safe. And he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed. But he is most definitely not. Our CBI is smart enough to get Chidambaram and all, but not him? Please.

757,"[AskIndia]South Indian Supporters of RSS, why do they believe in Hindutva?",21,awasht,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awasht/askindiasouth_indian_supporters_of_rss_why_do/,101,"AFAIK Hindutva/RSS's idea of Nationalism stems from the European idea of Nationalism and not the Gandhian one. RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism. ",1551509331.0,"South India is not a monolithic culture. 



Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TNMainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"".",AskIndia

760,[AskIndia] What song is this ?,6,comakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.

2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",1560165284.0,"We haven't got Jio Gigafiber yet in our city. 

How much do you for it and what's the plan? I'm currently using local broadband service that provides 20 Mbps speed for unlimited data at annual price of Rs 5500 and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Been using it for 1.5 years and still haven't faced any major issue with the service.For the first point , it’s triple play so everything is done through the ONT. so no use trying to bad mouth them for the unique experience 

Second jio uses CGNAT so no port forwarding at all.you’ll need to buy static ip to do the same and no this is not unique .almost all Indian isps do the same .",AskIndia

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Edit: This post is just sad as hell.",1555605245.0,"I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn’t with him in his last moments. 

I had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won’t be there. But when you hear this news you don’t seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It’s gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. 

The initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that’s  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .

And then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on.I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. 


Both my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.


Mentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.


 Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. 


It's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents.

777,[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,60,as8cj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8cj5/askindia_situation_with_parents_am_i_wrong/,43,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

TL;DR : 27M,Single, Live with parents in Mumbai. Parents keep fighting. Are controlling. Have big egos. Considering options in life without hurting them.

&#x200B;

Edit 1 : Added TL;DR",1550595226.0,"Upvoted for visibility.

I feel the same situation will arise in home after I get a decent job given your mom and my mom's share similar traits.

Hope you find a good way to dissolve things, OP! Good luck!General advice: It may sound selfish . But then this is the time to be selfish. 10 years down the line you will be in their shoes and not young enough to follow your dreams.

Step 1: threaten to leave if they don’t mend their ways. 

Step 2: if they don’t change then actually leave. Take a job outside. Once you are gone they ll realise your importance. A little bit of distance helps. Unless they realise your importance they won’t hear you.

Step 3: move back and make them move with you once things are normal and you feel they are ready to listen and change.

There is no point wasting your life trying to convince them when in their eyes their ego is bigger than peace of family and your career.Same story at my house too. This problem isn't something that appeared one day, this problem existed long time back since you were a child. Now trying to change it won't help much. Maybe they'll understand you are not liking it and will stay silent in front of you. But once your back is turned, it will start again.

&#x200B;

For now, I suggest you stay at distance from them. Rent a house bit away or else buy one. Because whatever the matter is you shouldn't let daughter of someone else suffer it after marriage. Plus, it will give time to your parents to adjust to your absence rather than it suddenly happening after marriage.

&#x200B;

Regarding 5th point, I did it. Moved to Pune from Mumbai, refreshed life. Now I have my own place, I got married. My parents visit us once in awhile, we visit them once in a while. But I am sure my wife wouldn't have been able to survive them. It's not abandonment, you can always bring them to your home when age catches up and they actually need you.

Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

After late 1700s-early 1800s, you could get yourself understood comfortably over large swathes of Northern India. Language was largely standardised in northern India at that point due to the influence of the British and more so, as they increased their influence and for administrative efficiency. 

And before that, inter-intelligibility of your spoken language would largely depend on the region you're in.  
If you spoke in standard sanskritised shudh hindi, you could've gotten by with reasonable comfort in eastern UP/bihar region. Linguists call this the Awadhi dialect. 
If you spoke in persianised hindi, with loanwords of persian origin, you could've got yourself understood in western UP, NCR, parts of Haryana and Rajasthan. There used to be a separate dialect called Brajbhasha spoken in these parts too, the language in which Meerabai wrote her poems.

So comfortably, let's say you could've made it work until about early 1600s.

So this happened to me after a Joined a well know IT company now my former organization, which prides its self to be ""ethical"". 

I was already employed when a had attended an interview with this company, After I was selected post interviews, I was asked to submit previous experience related documents, so that HR could prepare a compensation package. After submitting my documents to them, they took approximately a month and gave me an offer letter, which I accepted. I informed them of my notice period at that time to which they agreed. On completion of my notice period, I joined this company. The first day was induction, which went of fine. So far everything seemed good. On the second day during the orientation program, during the break HR asked me to meet them. There I was informed that ""we checked your documents again and it seems that there was a mistake in calculating your experience, so we are going to reduce the offer we had made"" Then they gave me two options, I accept the revised reduced compensation OR If its not OK I can leave.

I told them their new deal was not only unacceptable, but was also unethical. Since they had a more than a month to verify the documents and release the offer, it was not my fault but theirs. Also objected to the tone in which they said to take the revised deal or leave, as I had already left my previous job, and they could not just leave anyone high and dry. Since I was already a part of the organization now, I would not accept it, and told will definitely escalate this. Thankfully was able to get it escalated and the original offer stood. Still it left a bad taste. Just wondering how many other faced this situation there.

Update: As someone mentioned, I guess this was a screwup by someone in the intake team and they were trying to retrospectively  fix their error. I didn't have to actually escalate it, like in writing and inquiry stuff, spoke to the HR manager in charge, and was told they would look into it. Probably in the background they must have let it stand. Don't think it was an organizational policy, so naming the company may not be appropriate.&#x200B;

You need to start becoming nice to yourself first. When that genuinely happens standing up for yourself won't be that hard, like you'd do for anybody you truly love. Sadly, loving ourselves doesn't come that easily, because most people learn to see themselves from others' eyes. I'll tell you a secret, it's completely okay to get bullied, that is the nature of the world and not just for humans. Because there's always somebody smarter stronger than you. Most people will say you could use that as a fuel to become smarter stronger yourself, that's one approach, but it won't bring lasting happiness. Being okay and fulfilled with your weaknesses and flaws truly brings and happiness. And the knowledge that you're not passing the negativity to others. Generally, people like you who are not bullying somebody else weaker to vent are naturally better humans. You can keep aside all the religions of the world, this is the true religion, letting the negativity die at you.

799,[AskIndia] What are the unnecessary reactionary laws and rules that are enforced in India?,13,b4v7wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4v7wu/askindia_what_are_the_unnecessary_reactionary/,24,"Lets make a list of stupid/non-stupid laws that were enacted in reaction to an incident which make little to no sense when looked back at. 

I was reading [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4rtch/what_are_the_reasons_given_by_indian_government/ej91j9w/?context=9) and was thinking what laws you think were reactionary and make no sense in the long term but were enacted nevertheless. 

Lets not limit this to just bans

Off the bat from that thread. 

1. Window tints on cars [Incident ??]
2. Porn ban [Incident ??]

Also mention why the rule was enacted, based on which incident",1553454498.0,"1. Intercaste marriage rule is the dumbest and archaic of them all. 

After notifying the registrars office, couples details including picture is put on a notice board for 30 days and a letter to their residential addresses. 

Not sure why it is enacted. 

Edit:

2. We live in India, yet you can't drive a vehicle registered in a different state for more than 6 months. why can't they centralise the transportation department?

3. Mobile network - roaming charges if you don't have a special recharge. I can only think this is to make more money. 

I would very much like to know why the RTO isn't centralised and IC marriage rule in enacted. Pubg ban that May happen soon... Idk why Indians moms worry so much its not the games mistake that their kids play it 24x7 so instead of identifying the cause why your kid is playing so much Pubg or any other gane for that fact  they will just blame the game and say its Ruining my kids life ; your kid will anyway end up finding some other game or some other thing that he/she will end up getting addicted to something else and go on the wrong path if the real underlying problem is not solved >Window tints on cars [Incident ??]   
    
I remember it was enacted to avoid vehicle borne kidnapping incidents. Atleast that's what the news channels were talking about then.  
    
>Porn ban [Incident ??]

834,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,28,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,7,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",1585860887.0,"> While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age.

But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 10) Corporates join Ganga Rejuvenation effort

* A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), State Program Management Group-Uttarakhand (SPMG-UK) and Indorama Charitable Trust (ICT) to work together for renovation/ development of the Ghat at Badrinath and Ghats and Crematoria at Gangotri in Uttarakhandat a total cost of 26.64 Crore.
* Rivers in India have always been considered sacred and the Ganga river, in particular, is the identity and lifeline of India. Pilgrim sites and urban centers have developed along the river. These centers have drawn sustenance from the river and have been thriving over time. Ghats and Crematoria are part of the lifestyle of people and pilgrimages to visit the holy river Ganga play a vital role in strengthening the People-River Connect. Gangotri and Badrinath being part of the Char Dham yatra, are especially important. This MoU is a significant step for improving amenities and sanitation at these holy locations with the underlying spirit of partnership and of private corporates taking responsibility by contributing to the National Mission: Rejuvenation of the sacred river Ganga.
* The Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been developed by M/S WAPCOS, a Govt. of India Enterprise.
   * The activities under the project include:
      * Construction of Bathing Ghats and Crematoria
      * Repair and modernization of existing Ghats and Crematoria

860,Your thoughts on e-sports,55,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,47,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",1559652669.0,"The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India.

East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",1579979425.0,"How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal? Is your goal worth those sacrifice? You have a lot of soul searching to do here. If you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career, which, believe you me, everyone does. 

I'll give you two examples here, both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like. My friend named Ashish comes from a Marwari family and his father is a sales consultant. When he was 17, he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin, who was pursuing it in London and not become a CA like his father wanted him to be. He eventually gave into his father's wishes and pursued being a CA. It took him 7 years to become a CA but he eventually became one and now has his own practice. He earns decent money now, married but resents his father to this day.

The second guy, Nikunj, brilliant in studies, just like you, and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to 'waste' it by doing a commerce course. He never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it. He eventually got into actuarial science and flourished; eventually his relationship with his parents improved too. 

Take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life. Money will follow you no matter what. If you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter what.

P.S : Your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful. I hope you don't feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an Indian household after your marriage, if you choose to marry.

Why is that? Like Ford Raptor , GMC Denali, Dodge Hellcat, Cardilac, Even some of the Models of Merc and BMW. What might be the reason??",1578151921.0,"The Indian car market is very difficult to penetrate into. We want cars that are cheap to own, cheap to run, cheap to repair and still seats 4-5 people at least. Whereas in western countries, the market dynamics are twisted. In the US, for instance, sedans are most common whereas in India it's little econobox hatchbacks. They measure fuel economy in gallons and we do so in litres. We want a lot of features but aren't able to pay the price. Things like this is why a lot of car makers have cars exclusively made for India, such as the Renault Kwid. Most of the cars you mentioned in the original post are from GM - DMC, Cadillac, Dodge etc. To be blunt, GM makes atrocious cars with abysmal quality. It takes a fortune to repair most of these and you will have to repair them. Another issue is that most of these vehicles are huge and expensive, and a very few people will buy them even if it is sold in India. GM tried to establish a market in India with Chevrolet, but again failed miserably. BMW and Benz sell most of their models in India, but they don't sell most of their sports car line up because 99% Indians can't or won't buy sports cars. So, it makes no sense to sell them in India.US cars are garbage. GM had to quit India after trying to dump China-made Chevrolet Sail.

FCA brands like Dodge have poor reputation even in the US for reliability issues.

Even Merc and BMW dump outdated models in India which are prone to breakdown in Indian conditions.No market here. infrastructure is so bad that models of 90s or 80s of these high end cars remain no longer reliable",Sports

893,COVID-19 - Information,1,fm9kmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fm9kmq/covid19_information/,1,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

Now this is crucial part. India is a federal state and cannot impose restrictions directly as it is a state matter, until or unless Emergency is invoked.

Timeline of measures and recommendations to states:

**20th of March**

   * Working hours for all employees who attend office on a particular day should be staggered.
   * Further, States shall issue instructions for regulating hours in all services except for essential services. Industrial establishments to consider staggered timings and regulation of crowd in market should also be resorted to.
   * States shall issue directions to private sector to consider work from home wherever feasible.
   * All educational institutions, theatres, museums, gyms, exam centers, etc., shall be closed temporarily.
   * States shall take necessary actions to ensure that all sporting events, competitions and religious gatherings shall be postponed and it shall be ensured that required social distanced is maintained even in smaller gatherings.
   * With respect to public transport, it is directed that metros, railways, buses and airplanes shall consider decrease in frequency of their services, **alternate seating to ensure social distancing**.

   * Railways have already issued orders in deference to GoM directions wherein travel concessions for senior citizens and all others availing concessional booking except for patients, students and divyangjan category since 0000 hours of 20 March 2020 have been temporarily suspended.
   * Further, in order to protect the most vulnerable of our population, all states shall issue appropriate instructions where in all citizens above 65 years except for public representatives/government servants/medical professionals should be advised to remain at home and avoid gatherings except for medical reasons and need for essential services.
   * **Youth and citizens are urged to become volunteers to support the government’s ongoing efforts in management of COVID-19.**
   * Ministry of Pharma and Consumer Affairs to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant price for masks, sanitizers, and other health related logistic material and to facilitate their availability in all hospitals and to people at large. They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

**8th of March \[**[**https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf)**\]**

Some of the steps proposed:

&#x200B;

* Identification  of  facilities/buildings  that  can  be  used  as  quarantine  centres or  can  be converted to temporary hospitals with isolation facilities;

IMO, if this cannot be backed up with numbers and is just your or somebody's qualitative interpretation, it's better to remove it. The danger is that our whatsapp-level people will interpret ""very low"" as ""no risk"" and say measures like self-quarantine and abundance of caution are unnecessary because risk is low.

Anyway, I'd suggest you to stwrt watching EPL (English Premier League) matches (Weekends mostly, on Hotstar or Star sports). It's the most followed league. So, you can google the fixture timungs of top 4-5 teams in the league. 


You'll learn about the rules slowly by yourself as you gather more interest in the sport. Also, follow r/soccer for updates on International football. 


We've got ISL on national level too. You can follow r/Indianfootball for updates on that.Just start watching games and play as often as you can. There's nothing like the thrill of being involved in a nice passing move like the one you saw in the match on the weekend.  
  
Good/exciting teams to watch in the English Premier League (EPL) at the moment: Liverpool, Man City, Leicester City.  
  
I myself am an Arsenal fan and I invite you to join me in supporting the club if you're masochist who doesn't have enough pain and disappointment in your life.  
  
As for other leagues, I don't know much. Perhaps others can help you. As far as I can tell, pretty much all EPL games are broadcast in India. Most La Liga (Spain) and Bundesliga (Germany) games are broadcast. Serie A (Italy) and Ligue Un (France) are harder to follow.  
  
I suggest you don't pick a team to watch at first. Just watch whatever football you can. But my honest suggestion is to not feel pressured into supporting ""local"". Your time is precious. Football, playing or watching, is supposed to be recreational and enjoyable. Watching 22 guys kick and rush and plod around a grass rectangle can be difficult to really get into. But if you watch high quality football, there's nothing like it.  
  
The channel Tifo Football on YouTube has some really nice videos on history, tactics, and current news in football. Maybe others can mention more YT channels that put out good content. 
  
If you're a reader, I can't recommend anything more highly than the book Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It's a beautiful book that will introduce you to the history of the game, the quaint developments along the way, and some of the most fascinating and inspiring characters in the sport. I was already bitten by the bug before I read the book but reading it only intensified my love for the game and put me into a phase of obsessing over it.  
  
**Most importantly, I suggest you should not feel obliged to follow football because everyone around you is talking about it. I don't want to assume too much but the way your post is worded makes me think everyone around you mainly talks about football and you have nothing to contribute. If that's what they're doing then don't be hesitant about breaking it up and talking about something else which is of common interest. I've been that asshole who used to talk only football and had nothing to say about anything else. It's shit and I would have been grateful for friends who were willing to talk about other stuff.**  
  
If football doesn't catch your fancy, you don't need to watch it. It's a wonderful sport and I hope my suggestions are of help in getting you to love it the way I do but really, it's not the be all and end all. Most football bros eventually grow out of talking about it 24/7. Do what you like. Cultivate your own interests and introduce others to them like I'm trying to introduce to football. I'm sure they'll be grateful.[deleted]",Sports

* The worrisome man­animal conflict in the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) on account of water seems to be a thing of the past. There was no incident of wild animals straying into human habitations for water last year and it would hold good for the current season too as there is enough water for them to tide over the harsh summer in the Reserve, which is spread over 893 sq km of core area and 1,122 sq km of a buffer. 
* The Reserve covers areas in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, and Nirmal districts in Telangana

### 6) What is the happiness curriculum?

On her upcoming visit to India next week along with US President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump will visit a Delhi government school, where she will attend a happiness curriculum class.

#### What is it?

The curriculum is one of the flagship schemes of the Delhi government in the education sector launched in July 2018 in all MCD schools.

* The curriculum calls for schools in India to promote development in cognition, language, literacy, numeracy and the arts along with addressing the wellbeing and happiness of students.
* It further says that future citizens need to be “mindful, aware, awakened, empathetic, firmly rooted in their identity…” based on the premise that education has a larger purpose, which cannot be in isolation from the “dire needs” of today’s society.

 

### 7) The Sunderbans and Climate Change

* The monsoon in Sunderbans is likely to last longer and get more intense, according to a fact sheet titled The Sunderbans and Climate Change, which was made public during the ongoing Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.
* Climate specialists have predicted that as climate change progresses, monsoon seasons in the Sundarbans will become longer and more intense.

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country.You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree?

I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

You think NBA gives 2 shits about anything other than their bottomline? Look at how they placed a gag order on their players and staff about Hongkong but no such thing for topics regarding America.

927,I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough,29,dup4ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dup4ed/i21fcant_decide_if_my_bf28m_is_showing_red_flags/,35,"Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

There is nothing wrong in your expectations, or his behaviour. They are all choices people make. He seems certain about what he wants. You too, are certain, and when he crosses those lines, you are uncomfortable.

A relationship is about compromise. But compromise even if grudging initially, has to finally become one of happy acceptance. Otherwise, the insecurities will eat away at it slowly. He doesn't seem to be particularly compromising to me. You seem to be compromising, but very uncomfortably.

If possible, meet a therapist. Have a few sessions. A good therapist helps you clarify your own feelings and communicate them to yourself. That will help you decide.Is r/India going to be a relationship consultancy sub?",Sports

I have observed how people have this urge in themselves to judge others and think bad of them is, and I too have been there. Being grown up that way, maybe everyone has. 

Parents are insensitive to their children, most of them just have them coz society tells them to else they don't give a damn how is their child especially mentally, when its college time they order them to do a specific course as if they know the best while they don't know a single thing about their child. Yes there is change coming in this behaviour but there is still majority who will say it's bullshit and they own their children. They say that their children must study what they want them to, score what they want them to, love who they want them to and marry. Their talent is constantly suppressed at every step to the level they just become a follower when they had capability to be a leader.

Man is supposed to be loved and respected by his family even if he beats his wife, shouts at his children, have no social life whatsoever and is completely not understanding. 

People say their is equality but obviously they have to constantly remind themselves which group other person belongs to so ofcourse there is huge negativity to question of intercaste or interreligious marriage which inturn is best solution to vanish discrimination.

Even our newspaper do this discrimination, just read matrimonial section there, women needs to be fair always, less educated than groom always, have to cook, and will have to obey the order when family says no to work and ofcourse has to be of same caste and religion.

Man and even women believe girls are to be controlled that when they ask for freedom they deserve to be raped. There is so much filth in minds of people.

We are constantly been forced to love our parents no matter how wrong they are, respect elders no matter how bad their deeds are and on top of them believe in God that he will do everything good.

He seems quite optimistic about the move of scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which he hopes will bring prosperity to the region. With the scrapping of the bill, he hopes citizens of J&K will benefit immensely. He raised the following points to the benefit of the people of J&K:

1. State employees of J&K will be awarded same benefits as other state employees like LTCs, HRA, Education allowance, Health insurance, etc., some of which are currently not available to them.
2. Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.
3. Government's PM Scholarship scheme will be implemented there asap.
4. Voting rights will be awarded to people who migrated from Pakistan to J&K during partition.
5. The election system will remain the same as earlier where they will elect their own representatives.
6. PM has urged the film industries in India to invest more in J&K.

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above).

945,A guide to anti-particulate masks,60,dpa2c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dpa2c2/a_guide_to_antiparticulate_masks/,18,"I live in Gurugram and it's that time of the year when the air's out to kill you. I see very few people using anti-particulate masks around me. Now, I don't know if that recklessness, ignorance, badassery or dumbassery, but I am going to build on a comment I made on an earlier post by /u/UndeniableDork and write a guide to buying an anti-particulate mask. Before I start, resistance or immunity to particulates or pollution isn't a thing. Don't be an unscientific dumbass. Protect yourself and educate people you care about.

Down below are the different categories of masks along with an example Amazon link for the class. I do not endorse any of these products. These are just masks I've used over the last four years living in NCR and I don't have any complaints regarding their effectiveness. All of these, besides the exceptions mentioned, have protected me from breathlessness, irritated throat and upper respiratory tract infection.

1. I see a lot of people using the green surgical masks that are used in hospitals. This **DOES NOT** protect you from particulates. It works for airborne germs and will protect you from that guy who'll sneeze in your face while commuting on metro, but it does little for pollution. Most of the anti-particulate masks listed below help with germs as well, but if you're in an elusive unpolluted town with job opportunities, you can just get these to protect yourself in flu season. Price: [Rs. 5 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Filtra-4-Ply-Loop-Surgical-Face/dp/B00IIIKZK6/)
2. The cheapest anti-particulate masks are disposable ones that are sold in sets of one, three, five or ten. I used 3M, Honeywell and Dettol and they are all fine. I'm partial towards 3M and Honeywell because they have been making these masks and selling them as industrial personal protective equipment for decades now. Also, 3M and Honeywell masks sell well among the residents of other polluted cities around the world. Price: [Rs. 13.5 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/), [Rs. 33.9 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/)
3. The next tier is disposable masks with exhalation valves. The exhalation valves prevent moisture buildup inside the mask keeping is less humid preventing it from getting warm and uncomfortable. 3M and Honeywell sell these masks as well. Depending on the time duration you'd like to wear them and the amount of physical exertion you're likely to undertake, you'll have to get a mask with a single exhalation valve or two exhalation valves. Price: [Rs. 37 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004GV-Particulate-Respirator-Mask/dp/B01LF2QMRQ/), [Rs. 127.8 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Pollution-Foldable-Exhalation-Valve/dp/B01I9PVOPW/)
4. Then, there are high performance masks like the ones sold at Decathlon. You'll need these if you're planning to jog or cycle in a gas chamber. They also have dual ~~purification~~ exhalation valves ~~which are the main filtration component in the mask~~. The mask itself is reusable, but the purification filter must be replaced when you feel the air flow is getting limited. They admit more air flow than the ones above and they'll let you get more oxygen into your lungs while also blocking out particulates. *I haven't tried these masks and I cannot vouch for their effectiveness.* Price: [Rs. 499 per mask (Mask + Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8398131_sport-mask-light-blue.html#/254-), [Rs. 149 per filter (Replacement Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8397813_sport-mask-light-filter.html)
5. The most expensive ones are pretty looking masks like Vogmask and Cambridge mask that are made of cloth on the outside with a particulate filter inside. They also come with one or two exhalation valves. Some of these can be hand-washed an reused, but not with a detergent. Please remember that detergent fumes are carcinogenic. There are also masks with replaceable filters like the Decathlon one above. Some of these masks come with additional features such as activated carbon filters. These masks generally claim 95-99% efficiency. Price: [Rs. 299 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/PureMe-Reusable-Pollution-Activated-Filters/dp/B07KXMHNL7/), [Rs. 449 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Tdas-Anti-pollutiion-dustproof-Washable-Reusable/dp/B07YCWT6JY/), [Rs. 499 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NC8DW9Z/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Dettol-Anti-Pollution-Cambridge-Newton/dp/B07JP8RBQ2/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Vogmask-Noir-CV-N99-Large/dp/B01J6KOW62/)
6. Nasofilters are an indigenous (AFAIK) product that is a filter that sits at your nostrils rather than functioning as a mask. So far, I've heard mixed reviews about them. The issue is see with them is that they don't filter air that will enter your respiratory system through your mouth. [Rs. 33 per pair of Nasofilters](https://www.amazon.in/NANOCLEAN-GLOBAL-Nasofilters-Pack-Boxes/dp/B078X6YFC6/)

A mask is only as effective as its fit around your nose and mouth. Honeywell masks, in their product guides, have a good way to test the effectiveness of what your wearing. If your mask is sitting right, it will puff up a bit every time you exhale and collapse a bit every time you inhale.

EDIT: Some corrections regarding high-performance sports masks. If you're looking for a mask for a child or an infant, look for smaller sized masks since adult-sized masks do not fit their faces and can end up causing suffocation for them.

Get an air purifier for your bedroom. Sleep quality improves when the air around you isn't full of shit. If you're unwilling to spend money on an air purifier, you can buy a PM2.5 filter screen for your air-conditioner ([Rs. 350 for a pack of 2](https://www.amazon.in/3M-Non-Woven-Electrostatic-Purifying-Filter/dp/B06XY536LF/)).

TL;DR: Wear an anti-particulate mask, there's a mask for everyone whether you're a broke-ass student or someone who makes 1.6LPM.",1572486383.0,"Planning a trip with my toddler to Delhi in Nov 2nd week, she will be there for a week..worried for what should we do to protect her from pollution and particulate matter!",Sports

---
##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

Boxing - New wave of boxers. Also from what I understand we were doing better early too, but the association problems was an issue. New association gives stability. Also foreign coaches(Santiago Nieva -men's team and Raffaele Bergamasco- was youth and junior in-charge, after Youth World Championships success, now in charge of seniors too i believe). Still on senior level, at least in men's category, we're not at world standard.

Shooting - The new generation of shooters coming in should be credited to Bindra. He really inspired the kids. Also the facility has improved. Many new academies. Shooting is where we're going to be really good. Only problem i see is other than shooters who come from army background, it's really rich people sports.

Weightlifting - Other than Saikhom Mirabai Chanu and Jeremy Lalrinnunga, none is world class. But with every tournament, lifters are only improving, not going backwards. I believe the national coach Vijay Sharma is pretty good.

Table tennis - Massimo Costantini(national) is doing really good. And most junior players are inspired from Sharath Kamal Achanta. But none of our tt players are world class. The juniors Archana Kamath and Manav Takkar is doing good in junior circuit, but still wont defeat top 5 of Chinese/Japanese players. 

TLDR; Foreign coaches, funds. Efforts from star players who's inspiring new generation. And fantastic work done by OGQ,Gosports and obviously Indian army(weightlifting, boxing etc). And there is a long way to go.Commercial houses sponsoring these events. Privatization of leagues like ISL, Kabaddi, PBL (Premier Badminton League), Super Boxing League has resulted in athletes getting a lot of exposure to foreign coaches, learning new techniques and keeping themselves supremely fit.

Also, a little credit to the government who has actively supported these ventures.

Moreover, a lot of athletes are getting corporate and commercial sponsorships, enabling them to compete in almost all the tournaments around the world, thereby giving them precious practice against the best.",Sports
958,[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it? What should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process?,3,eai2nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eai2nk/general_what_is_your_opinion_about_the_iits_do/,9,"Some of you may have come across one of my previous posts in this subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5sqaz/im_jee_aspirant_is_there_any_chance_i_can_crack/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) if you're looking for the full story. Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of social interaction.",1576347055.0,"Fuck IIT. We don't need any more quora users around us. /s

But on serious note, IITs are one of the few options of becoming 1.6lpm earner in 4 years and can help a lower middle class person jump to upper middle class.

If you feel you aren't cut-out for IIT thats okay. There isn't a need to discredit that institution with made up stories.Cracking JEE and getting admission into an IIT has become more oriented around getting that celebrity status (you'll already know if an IIT is living in a radius of 50 KM or... three in-laws relations). 
I have seen Indian parents worshipping IITian like literally putting them on a pedestal, a prodigy, an example to your spoiled brat. It's more because of the hype of IITs. 
I remember vividly, when I was in 10th and one of my friends asked me - ""*Will you go for IIT?*"" , at that time I have no idea about even it's existence, it was like some new fad everyone's talking about.
I won't say JEE is biased though. But the competition has given to a varieties of problems. Depression, anxiety, anti-social living has become the pre-requisites for an IITian. We have to tackle this somehow before it's too late to be dealt with.Look, I get all the lack of research and creativity and all that stuff... But the fact of the matter is that an IITian tag is something that almost guarantees a better professional and social life.

An institute is much more than its admission process. The access to resources, alumni network, placecom networks, seniors etc is something that will give you a huge advantage all your life.",Sports

961,My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,14,d7lsqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7lsqd/my_assessment_on_indian_olympics_contingent/,13,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",1569155785.0,"Sports budget must be made 10x and schools/colleges must encourage sports.

962,Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration?,10,e9nmtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e9nmtc/are_there_no_centrists_in_india_who_are_not/,5,"I am a centrist. An Indian who believes that Govts and political parties are not boyhood football, cricket and other sports teams that you have to be loyal to and support no matter what or oppose no matter what. 

I can praise a party for the right steps they took and criticise the same people for the wrong ones. 

Just like it happens in good corporate cultures. Based on merit & performance. 

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress. 

For eg. Not everything that a party XYZ has done is correct because you support them and not everything the same party did is wrong is because you loathe them. 

Currently I find it difficult to find like minded people who are objective in their outlook without having to identify themselves rigidly with being completely anti someone or completely pro someone. I feel we can never progress until we come out of this fanboyism. 

This is not an agenda I'm trying to propagate, but perhaps I can be enlightened by some insights on why this happens.",1576186539.0,"I have little problem being objective if a party is anchored towards moderation and liberalism in governance.

BJP under Vajpayee was still rightwing hindutva but didn't go crazy with social engineering or illiberalism, and stuck to the secular constitutional principles prevalent till then. I didn't like some of their lapses such as the 2002 pogrom and attempts at saffronizing education then, but I also had no problem appreciating the nuclear tests, the NH network, Kalam's nomination as president, the Kargil victory, and even the post-parliament attack kashmir standoff.

Similarly, I appreciate congress of the 90s and 00s for their economic developments, Nehru's nation building, RTI and NREGA UBI under MMS. At the same time, I absolutely hated Indira and Sanjay's authoritarianism that resulted in enduring degeneration of Indian politics, corruption of people like Kalmadi, MMS saying he's helpless about corruption due to ""coalition dharma"", poor governance in my state of Karnataka under Rahul Gandhi's insipid leadership. 

It's possible to be objective about moderate politicians and parties.

But BJP under Modi and Shah turned out to be a whole different ballgame. Till end-2015 or so, I assumed Modi had matured on being made PM, come out of his Gujrat pogrom mindset, and himself become a ""centrist"". I even remember mentally appreciating the rafale ready-to-fly deal of 2015 thinking here's somebody more efficient than our babus. Then slowly the incessant shitshow started and has never stopped from 3 years - biased jingoistic media, demo craziness, incessant propaganda, IT cell mischief, fake news, murder of a judge, supreme court bench fixing, lynchings, complicated GST, electoral bonds, Rafale corruption, NRC social engineering, Kashmir fiasco.

This is not just another party. I see them as now as literally extremists of the taliban variety, who also happen to be dishonest, incapable, corrupt and authoritarian. A political mafia is what they are. It's not mentally possible for me to appreciate the ""good"" deeds of such extremists. It's the equivalent of hearing ""yes, asaram and his son molested young girls but so what? at least he built schools too"". Some roads built or some gas cylinders handed out doesn't redeem extremists. Let them turn themselves away from their current path and return governance back towards liberal constitutionalism and institutional democracy, and then we can think of returning to centrism.I'm pretty sure that there are centrists among us. It's just that the mindset of ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" is strongly reinforced in our current political climate. If a person supports a certain initiative, they are lumped into the party that leads it. Being lumped comes with the assumption that the person shares the same ideology of said political party which, for the most part, is true. There are exceptions, of course (like being a centrist).

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

Am I only one being overtly sensitive to this situation or is this an actual thing?",1569453484.0,"Along with being a foodie, wanderlust, sapiosexual etc., love of pets has been a forced trend of sorts. This sub too caught on that trend lately. 

Getting out of marriage is understandable if they strongly want a pet and you are totally against it. However, alienating people just because they don't like pets is taking things to the extreme.I think if you are a nice person in general, people will like you. If someone makes a massive deal out of you not liking animals, you're better off without them. I mean, avoiding or ostracising people over something they like (interests like animals, movies, etc.) don't like is a very shallow and childish way to behave.

I knew a person who hated pets. Or any animals. I and a lot of people disliked her, but not for her hating animals. She was just an asshole in general.Regarding the marriage alliance, why would she want to be with someone who doesn't want the same things in life? For her, her pet dog was probably more important than some random person. Obviously, she's gonna reject the person who has clearly told her that he doesn't want pets.",Sports

Prasar Bharati is a **statutory autonomous** body set up by an Act of Parliament and comprises the Doordarshan Television Network and All India Radio, which were earlier media units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Doordarshan (DD) is an **autonomous** public service broadcaster founded by the Government of India, owned by the Broadcasting Ministry of India and one of Prasar Bharati's two divisions.

The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry, under Ms. Smriti Irani, had tried intervening in the functioning of the Prasar Bharati by withholding funds and assigning a bureaucrat to the Board. The board had [protested this citing their autonomous status](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prasar-bharati-rejects-ministrys-directives/article22765564.ece). It also said certain directives would benefit private broadcasters. 


>The Ministry also wants general entertainment channels to be replaced by channels run by Union Ministries. 

>The Prasar Bharati Board, however, has contended that it would make the bouquet uninteresting. The viewership of Doordarshan would “crash and Tata Sky and Zee Entertainment Dish TV will go laughing all the way to the Bank,” the documents stated.

The Ministry [denied intervening](https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ministry-denies-vendetta-against-prasar-bharati/article22914082.ece).

992,Bala movie: A mix of new and the old (Analysis),18,du8jny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/du8jny/bala_movie_a_mix_of_new_and_the_old_analysis/,4,"I was expecting nothing from the movie Bala because of majorly 2 things. First, I had checked twitter and found people with negative reviews (well Twitter is negative about everything these days) and secondly I had to walk out of the movie ""Dreamgirl"". I like Ayushmann but I found ""Dreamgirl"" pretty average and the movie felt like a culmination of comedy circus scenes. Thus, I was sceptical.

I was totally wrong. Bala is an Ayushmann khurana trademark movie. Ofcourse the director Amar Kaushik and the entire cast are responsible for the success. But, this movie is not merely about a good script selection. Ayushmann did a marvelous job of a frustrated insecured bald guy. I could relate to his frustration. The portrayal is just too realistic. 

Now, directly coming to the themes the movie touches. (Contains Spoilers)

1. Insecurities - The movie uses Baldness (primarily) and dark complexion as insecurities people have and how the world is hell-bent on shaming them. It sees Baldness and skin tone in a completely different way. Baldness touching the masculine charm and skin colour determining the feminine side. It explores these two ideas. 

Another insecurity it explores is the millennials quest for an enhanced pseudo identity on social media platforms. Bala gets upset about his baldness because he thinks he is not presentable on Instagram and Tiktok. The material socialisation of social media where we long to get likes in our videos, intellectual brainstorming statuses and etc. Yami Gautam's character comes in the frame here as she is a viral star with modeling aspirations.

2. Status quo - Javed Jaffrey remarks in the movie, that looks don't matter for men as it is a patriarchal society and after marriage the girl has to stay with the husband irrespective of her choice cause she is now tied. In the marriage it constantly challenges this notion. Bhumi Pednekar who is herself a lawyer, encourages a women to leave ger husband who was justifying her husband's cheating because of her weight. Yami Gautam files a divorce suit after she finds Bala is bald and has lied to her about his hair. It tries to break away from the marital trap of a women. 

3. Religion - Bollywood has attempted to touch religion in films like PK, OMG! Bala's addressing of religion is inclusive. Initially it criticises Lord Krishna for beautifing a dark toned into a fair skinned girl. In the end it analyses the situation in a completely different way. Krishna was not trying to change her into fair skin, the Lord was trying to make her realise that she is beautiful. This positive interpretation and understanding of India's religious practices is commendable because many a times we associate reformation with total denunciation of religion. India's secularism has always been about plurality and not about separation of church (here religion) from the state.

4. Pop culture

It touches upon the pop culture that shames dark skinned women by mocking certain Bollywood songs. It doesn't resort to any blame game because during that time subtle misogyny was evident everywhere rather it tries to remind us how subconsciously how we have been indoctrinated with the thought that beauty means fair.

5. Staying true to yourself

Both the women lead are true to their archetype. Bhumi although felt upset as a kid when she was shamed for being dark, she doesn't let it affect her way of life. She finds social media irrelevant to project a different self and tries to live her life with her ideals. Yami on the other hand is a product of social media. She is aware of her ""beauty"" appeal and uses that to build a brand around tiktok (just like a modern day influencer). She herself admits that ""externalities"" is her way of life and without that she is nothing. That bedroom scene with Ayushmann was much needed because there's a nerd culture being developed which shames people too much. ( So, what if someone uploads a selfie or a Tiktok video? Can we just mind our won business if we don't like it. If one is self aware of their potential and knows the market, exploiting it through social media is not a sin.) It is still better than the hypocrite Ayushmann who tries to fake it. Yami is not faking it. She is aware of her ""externality"" aspect. 

6. Activism: The best cinematic aspect of Bala is that the movie is not preachy. It is subtle in its activism. It doesn't call any names to direct blame, it highlights the normalisation of practices. Like fairness obsession, body shaming and even new ones like social media's edited reality. It depicts the shallowness of being too filmy. Bala's need for gratification comes from the fact he wants to emulate Bollywood behaviour. 

7. High school nostalgia: Bala tried so hard to have his hair back is because of the appreciation he received in school. A lot of people are stuck in their school days because they had a particular identity in school. Some were good at sports but later ended up in a deadbeat job and in the case of Bala, it being the popular kid in class. People are obsessed with the highschool nostalgia as they want to go back to those days to escape the monotony that employment and real life offers.

The most important point: Is Bala a traditional Bollywood hero? Well, Bala has certain flaws. He is bald which the B'town hero rarely is. He is insecured. Our heroes maybe big time fraud in their films but they are never insecured. Bala is different to a Bollywood hero. Bala doesn't get the girl. He gets rejected by Bhumi as she is in love with someone else. Also, it doesn't follow the Bollywood style of falling in love with the second girl (read rebound) in movies such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hain. Yammi ends up divorcing Bala.

But, but it follows the conventional hero arc in the end. Because the movie is all about Bala's victory over his insecurities. It is about his catharcis which he has in his last ""fairness"" cream presentation. It is about his reversal of fortune from being an average comedian to a well loved one. He follows the athenian ideal hero in a way. (Except he doesn't visit the underground) Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala and fights his case (it initially felt like she loves him but benefit of doubt she was fighting for herself as well as she might relate to Bala's baldness in a way as she has suffered societical taunting for her skin tonned)

Bala might have deviated from mainstream Bollywood norms (althout it is itself a commercial movie) but it adheres to the policy of The Indian Hero resurgence.

To conclude, all this analysis holds no value if the movie is boring and Bala is far from that. It is a fun watch.",1573400154.0,Any spoiler free tl;dr? ;),Sports

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

> ... The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.

> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**”Well.

I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
",1498235539.0,"I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

 To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do",Non-Political

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I guess Andy Dufresne was right, it does come down to a simple choice really. Get busy living or get busy dying.",1472181710.0,"OP, do not continue your business because you buy into what I call as ""success porn"" where one is constantly bombarded with motivational quotes and stories of entrepreneurs rescuing businesses from the brink of their death.

Take a calm, logical look at your situation separating emotion from the process completely. If you were just handed this business today, what would you do? Sometimes shutting down your business is the right thing to do. Upvoting for visibility in the hope some experienced hand pours some wisdom. Business is harrrd!

In India, it takes a lot of guts to take up what you love and pursue it as a career because our parents love us too much to make some risky decisions. 

I am 21 years old now all I did was to follow the path showed by my parents. I never got to know what I love because I didn't there were many options in this world. All I knew was if you want to live a life decently you have to do an engineering job and get a job in a government organisation. 

Engineering opens your doors to the world it shows the all those things you left behind. It starts throwing things at your face saying ""You could have been a lawyer, you could have been an artist, you could have been an artist, blah blah"".With all these revelations about the world, I continued my engineering. I broke my heart, I became a writer, I became a poet, I tried everything in the last 3 years but I couldn't find something which I can hold on to or I can pursue it as a career. Engineering has something for me, it took time but it finally entered into my lazy life.

It took me off my legs, I suddenly felt this is something I can fight for, this is something I can think about all the time, this is the something for which I can wake up at sleep at 5 am daily, this was something I could do all the day and not get bored. 

I started working for The Monologue, NO NO, I don't work for The Monologue, it is something more than it. The Monologue is a platform for storytellers, poets and musicians in Gujarat, India. We are just a group of 7 engineers who have been working in and out al the day just one goal to become the best at what we do. One day I hope that we become the best at what we do.

Most of our parents don't know what we are doing or don't feel that it is a potential career to pursue to live a decent life. I hope one day we prove them wrong too.  

I told you this story because I am the guy who looks after the marketing of The Monologue. I stumbled upon a seminar of Seth Godin(I totally love his ideas on how the world and marketing should be) which can totally turn around the way I see things BUT that costs $745(huge money for an engineering student studying in India). So, I thought maybe someone can help with that kind of, but it doesn't matter now(You read this story that is enough for me). just follow us on Facebook or Instagram search for "" Themonologuein"" that will mean the world to me.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

[Non-Political],17,1xb2ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1xb2ni/could_someone_give_me_advice_on_approaching_an/,46,"I am not Indian. Said Indian girl is a coworker. I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",1391839318.0,"just be normal!

Dear Rashmi,

I have been noticing you everyday throwing away perfectly good styrofoam cups in the bin. As these are non-biodegradable and costly cups, I feel it is very wasteful to throw them away after just one-time use. I have been collecting all the cups you threw away on a daily basis and I am using them myself to reduce the environmental impact. 

How about we start sharing our styrofoam cups everyday from here onwards. Will save me the trouble of keeping an eye on you and diving into the bin to retrieve your cup. :) This will definitely save the company a lot of money in the long run and it makes everything I drink taste sweeter. :) We can talk to the CEO about importing *kulhads* from your exotic native land and share  one kulhad per team. This would surely increase the team spirit and harmony among all of us. I invite you for sharing a cup of coffee, if you want, today evening in the cafeteria. :)

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",1465407405.0,So you believe what PN is saying to be true.[deleted],Non-Political

Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

",1416765854.0,"1. Most of India's radio listeners listen to local language radio with local language music. 

2. Yes, independent Music Culture is huge. Musicians make music with instruments & recording equipments n stuff in studios, and then look for labels to produce & market their music. there is a channel called mtv indies i think.

3. do You know of spanish operas soaps ? We have a similar series here involving women and their mothers-in-law. Youth hardly watches TV nowadays. Satyamev Jayate was big in first season, now it is not getting as much promotion in the media.
I don't know of other similar shows. 

4. tv18 is big. You could start there. NDTV is big. 

5. Most news from news channels. some of it from newspapers. headlines today, ndtv, cnn-ibn, times-now. are big news channels. but most of india watches aajtak and india tv. 

6. Maybe 1 in ten people read the news. (ofcourse this sample of  10 folks  are the from the richest 10% of the country.  )

Almost everybody has pretty much figured out how media is paid to hush up particular events, and sensationalize certain other events.

Creating a joint account wherein you transfer an equal amount from your salary for budgeted monthly expenditures. Use this for all day to day expenses. If there is a significant difference in your income levels, you can choose to pool funds proportionately.


Another joint account wherein you transfer an amount that is proportional to your respective incomes for common goals (like an upcoming vacation or down payment for a house and/or servicing EMIs. This account can also be used for pooling investable surpluses.

I contacted Amazon about the issues I’ve had with Bluedart and how I was going to end up disappointed with my first Amazon.in purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

1166,[NON-POLITICAL] Investing in the US,4,3s708w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3s708w/nonpolitical_investing_in_the_us/,8,"Financially does it make any sense to invest in the real estate market in the United States?

A very close friend of mine is asking me to invest in his real estate/business venture as a partner. I'm one among 80 or so partners. Most of them are in India and a few in the US. The venture specializes mostly in the San Francisco and East bay real estate markets and only deals in commercial property. Hotels, Office spaces, Apartment complexes and such. The company itself is registered in the State of California.

My question is, do I have any advantages to investing in that market? Taxwise, do I have any benefits when I repatriate the profits back to India? Most importantly will my money grow? The US has low inflation comparatively, so that should help. But am I missing something?

The idea of owning/co-owning property in the US is appealing, but I'm sure there must be pitfalls. ",1447137630.0,"Inquilab Zindabad. Swadeshi hi use karenge!I think it is a bad idea. Why would you invest in the US from India?! 
Most NRIs invest in Indian real estate. 

Real estate in America barely moves, unlike India. 
Example: My uncle bought a $800,000 house in bay area in 2002, it is now worth $1.2mil. (standard in bay area. any decent house in a decent area is near 1 mil) If he had invested that 800k in India (say bangalore, it would definitely be worth anywhere from 1.6mil to 5mil by now. I know bangalore is an exception but still in 10 years, it is not hard to get double of your investment in India)
Indian real estate moves much much faster. No brainer.

Also there are 2 trends in bay area right now. Tech industry is doing really well, so number of jobs is increasing very fast, this has created a rapid demand for rental space and houses. Rental rates have shot up. 

San francisco has reached ridiculous levels for rent. Thats because of this massive startup scene. Startups there pay ridiculous amounts of money as salary and so rent has skyrocketed. (thanks to uber, airbnb and many 100s of other startups doing really well based off of SF)
But people expect something to happen soon. This rise is unsustainable. A lot of jobs are moving to San Diego etc Some companies are just quitting california because it is ridiculous here (toyota moved its entire plant to texas). They can have 1.5 employees elsewhere vs 1 employee here. So looks like Bay area's rise in rent and real estate is nearing its peak. (ofcourse the value will go up probably 15-20% in a couple of years, but indian real estate moves much much faster. so no point investing here)

I have tried emailing animal welfare organisations and national newspapers, but i haven't got a reply from any of them. Therefore i come to reddit as a last resort, in hoped of getting justice for those poor souls who did nothing wrong and yet were denied their very existence.
Here are some pictures of the process that happened right in the complex - http://imgur.com/a/AfNQY
Thank you.",1464185727.0,"Holy Hell!! That is terrible :( Such unnecessary measures for some tiny defenceless puppies.

I don't know enough to help you, but please let us know if there is a resolution to this. Have you tried tagging any animal welfare organisations on twitter along with photos of this incident?

India needs more people like you who don't sit quietly while such atrocities are committed.Not only are both the acts of cruelty and the subsequent attempts at intimidating you terrible, they are both highly also illegal and in contempt of court.

Here are all the pertinent laws and court rulings for you to take up a case with the police, media, and a lawyer. Don't back down, you are fully within your rights, and have proof of the acts of cruelty, the people who have claimed responsibility in writing, and their attempts to intimidate you. 

You have witnessed a crime and they have tried to silence you, don't let them succeed.

As per Indian law, **street dogs cannot be beaten, killed or driven away or displaced or dislocated**, they can only be sterilized in the manner envisaged in the The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001  enacted under the Indian Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 (A Central Act), vaccinated, and then returned back to their original locations.

Rule 6 and Rule 7 of The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, state as follows:

> Rule 6 clearly envisages that **even if the Municipal Corporation thinks it expedient to control street dog populations; IT CANNOT RESORT TO KILLING OR DISLOCATING**. 

> It can only sterilize and immunize the dogs, and then **leave them at the locations that they had been picked up from**.

> Rule 7 deals with the procedure to be followed upon receipt of a complaint. Please also note, **the Municipality, cannot just pick up dogs, simply because some persons/administrators don’t like their being around**. 

> Even the **dogs that are complained about can only be sterilized and immunized, and then left back at the locations that they had been picked up from**.

Please note **there is a specific bar against dislocating dogs**, since the same tends to interfere with and jeopardize the area-wise animal birth control. **For the area-wise sterilization program mandated by law, dogs have to be returned back to their original habitat** after sterilization and immunization. These dogs then tend to fight off other, newer, possibly unsterilized and unvaccinated dogs from entering their territories, since dogs are highly territorial in nature. 

> Dislocation of street dogs has time and again proven to be counter-productive and only favours the entry of other non-sterilized street dogs into the area, which will not only be unknown to you but also to those who tend to the area’s street dogs, thus raising more cases of man-animal conflict.

**Ministry of Public Grievances Circular on Street Dogs to Central Govt Employees dated 26.5.2006**

**The Stray feeding guidelines by the Department of Personnel & Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, New Delhi letter no.F.No.30/9/2006-WELFARE dated 26.5.2006, applicable for:**

> Treatment of street dogs by government servants: If any Govt. Servant indulges in act of cruelty to animals he will be making himself liable for action under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Besides, punishment under the Act, he would also make himself liable for action under CCS (Conduct) Rules for conduct unbecoming of a Govt. Servant.

> Resident Welfare Associations, citizens and others: Stray animals are to be dealt with through designated agencies in Govt./local self-government organizations/ NGO’s etc.  Recognised Associations in Govt. colonies may approach such Institutions for redressal of their grievances. All the problems of stray animals have to be handled within the institutional framework available and NO resident association, recognized or unrecognized, shall take recourse to action on their own, either themselves or through any person employed by them like security guards etc.

**The Delhi High Court, vide its rulings in 2009 and 2010, have also actually ordered the Police to protect persons who feed and care for street dogs, and who are often exposed to the ire of ill-informed, ill-advised residents/administrators of those areas.**

> The Delhi High Court in its judgement, pronounced on 18.12.2009 and 4.2.2010, says that “it is necessary to bring into record that these individuals and families who adopt stray animals are doing a great service to humanity as they are acting in the aid and assistance of Municipal Authorities by providing these animals with food and shelter and also by getting them vaccinated and sterilized. Without assistance of such persons no local Municipal Authority can successfully carry out its ABC programme”.

> The Court has proceeded to say that “the local police and the municipal authorities are under obligation not only to encourage such adoption but also to **ensure protection to such persons who come forward to take care of these animals specifically the community or neighbourhood dogs so that they are not subjected to any kind of cruelty”**, finally, the Court has said “that every individual has the right to live his life in the manner he wants and it is necessary that the society and the community recognize it”.

Also remember that under the Indian laws, animal cruelty is an offence – under Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and Section and 429 of the Indian Penal Code – punishable with imprisonment and fine. Likewise, **criminal intimidation, and criminally intimidating animal welfare volunteers is a serious offence under the Indian Penal Code (specifically, Section 503 of Indian Penal Code read with Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code 1860).**

I would also highly recommend going reaching out to this organisation for help and advice.

But most importantly, now that you are armed with the laws and know your rights, go to the police and/or get a lawyer (to file a case of both animal cruelty and criminal intimidation). 

PRINT THIS OUT and take it with you, so that you can show them the laws in writing and they take you seriously.

That being said, there are a LOT of safe, fun places in Delhi - India Habitat Centre, Hauz Khas village, India Gate and the surrounding historical monuments, Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place, and even the Bangla Sahib gurudwara has magnificent architecture, if you're into that sort of thing.

Delhi, being a longtime capital of India, is a city of vibrant history and a cultural salad bowl, as opposed to a cultural melting pot. A lot of this history and culture can be found in the gardens on every corner, or in the old time coffee houses in Connaught Place, or any one of the hundreds of bazaars littering the NCR.

>* MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India has identified 150 truant corporate borrowers whose accounts banks have been told not to sweep under the carpet.The instruction comes within days of RBI governor Raghuram Rajan setting a deadline of March 31, 2017, for banks to clean up their balance sheet with stressed loans crossing double digit in most banks.This is the first formal dialogue initiated by the regulator to drive home the point that banks should not disguise sticky loans as standard loans to shore up their profits.The list of 150 companies comprise accounts where the corporate debt restructuring has failed and where there is a divergence in the way different banks have classified the loan - with some categorising them as non-performing assets while others continuing to recognise them as well-behaved, standard accounts.

>* ""We have received a letter from RBI listing close to 150 troubled corporates accounts which it thinks must be downgraded,"" a senior banker told ET, requesting anonymity.Bankers are worried their performance may suffer in the coming quarter as they make higher provisions on accounts pointed out by the central bank.

RBI is aiming to remove differences in treatment of loans,"" said another RBI official.In the letter, RBI has also told banks they can present their argument to statutory auditors if they wish to retain any of the loans (on the list) as a standard account.

>* But, bankers fear that since auditors would prefer to be regulators' good books, they would end up endorsing RBI's views.

>* ""RBI does not appear to be in any mood to negotiate on the classification of bad loans.The meeting was called to understand banks' strategy because bad loans could cause some banks to bleed and make it tough for them to raise capital,"" said a senior banker.Data compiled by ETIG shows bad loans have jumped sharply to Rs 3.11 lakh crore in 2014-15 from Rs 92,515 crore in 2010-11.

Escuse me for bothering you with a travel related question. Furthermore I understand that some of you are tired of 'westeners in yoga pants'. Please understand that I am not visiting your country out of an idea that you are nothing more than a spritual country.

With this said I am seeking your advice.

I am an european male travelling to India in about a month time. I have heard many good stories from friends who have been in your country. I will be in India for about 6 months (October - April) I think. If money and desire suffices.

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

I really appreciate your help.",1410386689.0,"I may be a bit biased since I lived in Pune when I was younger and have a soft spot for the city. There are a lot of nice Yoga retreats/ashrams in Pune. Here's two that you can be fairly confident will meet or exceed your expectations:

1. [Osho](http://www.osho.com). They have a very peaceful, clean retreat. I have heard that they offer work/live programs where you can volunteer and have some of the dues paid off that way.
2. [RIMYI](http://www.bksiyengar.com/modules/institut/rimyi/rimyi.htm). This is B. K. S. Iyengar's Yoga retreat. Mr. Iyengar passed away recently. The Institute is dedicated to his wife. Not sure if they have classes.

There might be others that I don't know about. Seems like you are open to experiences and not afraid of trying things out. Pune would be ideally suited for something like that.

BJP, not because I'm convinced they are the best for our country. Merely by process of elimination. I worry about the Hindutva agenda being brought to the forefront, however, BJP leaders have been *saying* all the right things. I guess we'll find out about this. For me, a question mark still hangs over Modi's involvement in the 2002 riots. However, I am cautiously optimistic about the future with BJP in power. I feel like they would have nothing to gain and everything to lose if they supported/ignored any rioting. 

**Predicted outcome:**
BJP emerges as the single largest party in Parliament (likely).
NDA (pre-poll alliance) wins absolute majority (somewhat likely).
Modi wins Vadodara and Varanasi. Consequently, Kejriwal loses and goes back to contesting elections in Delhi (which I don't expect him to do very well in).
Rahul Gandhi wins by a very small margin (I would love it if Smriti Irani beats him though).

**Development and Infrastructure projects:**
I haven't reviewed the BJP manifesto, but this had better be pretty high up on their list of priorities after everything they have said about this. I remain cautiously optimistic.

**Economy:**
Modi has a track record of keeping the economy growing (even if the rate is growth is debated by various sections), so I am optimistic on that front.

**Education:**
I haven't heard very much about education and I would like more time/effort/money devoted to this field. India's education system is long overdue for a big overhaul.

**Foreign policy:**
I am concerned about foreign policy, particularly with regard to the US. Parts of the US are quite anti-Modi, which may cause a lot of friction in our relations. I also worry about our relations with Pakistan since there is quite an anti-Modi sentiment there as well.

**Media coverage:**
It has been a complete circus. There was a front page post recently ranting about how ridiculous our mediapersons are and I fully agree with that. It is very difficult to judge the landscape and make predictions while the coverage of daily events remains so shoddy and overly focused on trivial *controversies*.

**Arvind Kejriwal:**
Such a wasted opportunity. Kejriwal was always held to a higher standard, because he made me dare to believe that there could be a higher standard for an Indian politician. However, he squandered that opportunity. It is unlikely that he will ever enjoy the same level of support as he did right before the Delhi elections. I respect where he is coming from and applaud his desire to change the political landscape of India. However, I don't like the way he has gone about it. He talks a big game, but ultimately he is prone to reactions that come across as temper tantrums and petulant behavior. India needed a statesman and his good intentions notwithstanding, I don't think Kejriwal is one.[deleted]",Non-Political

1203,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,8,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",1532391253.0,"why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job?I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them.

**India top-ranked country in mobile data consumption: Amitabh Kant**

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

1214,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",1558060692.0,,Science/Technology
1215,Need help with depression and anger.,8,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",1519186110.0,"Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :) Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.

1216,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",48,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

",1435198646.0,"Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year?I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",1403105851.0,"Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",Science/Technology

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

1240,[Serious Post] Bye,376,f161mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/,124,"It's about time for me. I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",1581266387.0,"You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic.

>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

Wishing all the very best to ISRO!For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race.Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations.",Science/Technology

Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder.

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

1260,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,499,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1401,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",1575564775.0,"The priorities of the people and (so) of the government are wrong.

They won't invest in education and healthcare. In fact the people of India will not elect a party that sets healthcare and education its priority. They will elect a party that promises to bomb Pakistan or throw the Muslims in the sea.

1270,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,82,ei5wg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/,16,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey?

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices.

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that.

You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

# Observations
* Congress manifesto is longer.

Let's discuss these manifestos!

",1554751157.0,"It is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each Government since as far as I remember fails miserably. No doubt, improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems - both social and economical- that I feel hopeless whether I look at these parties. At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country. This brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost.  we have to wait years when well-being of our countryman is the first and last topic in any political debate.Congress:

>Congress promises to pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of 33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. 

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it?I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for. So, how do I go about doing a SWOT analysis, so to speak, that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? I really don't want to hit the NOTA , I'd rather sit at home then.  
Edit : I'll read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide. Thanks for the input folks!",Science/Technology
1290,Anyone here who has graduated from or is getting their degree from IIST (Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology),14,1pwsfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1pwsfe/anyone_here_who_has_graduated_from_or_is_getting/,1,"[Link](http://www.iist.ac.in/)

I have a couple of questions. 

1. How did you find the syllabus different from regular run of the mill engineering college.
1. How would you rate the seriousness and dedication of fellow students. 
1. The website tells me that most students do an internship at one of the ISRO facilities. Did you get such an opportunity ? How was your experience ? Did you contribute to an actual projects (even if in minuscule way)
1. And finally what's the employment situation like. Do a lot of people get absorbed into ISRO ? Do a lot of people like that or do you see a lot of ""brain drain"" ?
",1383636793.0,"No idea about IIST, but ISRO regularly launches various student satellites which piggyback with the main payloads.

1291,Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,0,eh3s70,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eh3s70/will_the_conflict_between_india_and_pakistan_ever/,9,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.",1577637929.0,"well if the conflict ends then our politicians will run out of topics for campaign.Our conflict always benefits those in power.

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

[https://www.newsclick.in/4-years-systematic-destruction-education-under-modi-regime](https://www.newsclick.in/4-years-systematic-destruction-education-under-modi-regime) 

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",1574968777.0,"Do invest your time in courses outside campus.
They surely boost your chances for better packageYou cannot do just one. You need to know both technologies and have problem solving ability. PSA builds by more practice, whereas knowledge of a framework comes with a little less. 

You have to choose b/w full stack dev, data analyst, and other options. Stick to one path,  learn the tech (take a month or less and learn it through a project that you can upload on GitHub), and then start practicing from hackerearth, etc. Don't try to become the best programmer, instead try to crack the interview. Go through geeksforgeeks and in maybe 2 months have an understanding of the algos and types of questions asked. Then start applying.",Science/Technology

But I don't enjoy my job and I dread to go to office on Mondays. I'm no technology enthusiast and have no ""love"" for programming/developing/whatever else to do with tech.

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc) 

So, please guys, I'm really serious and I feel like I'm risking it all. So, please restrain from sarcasm and mockery.",1571063873.0,"If you're sure about point 3,
Then try UPSC or SSC exams
i.e. IAS IPS or CDSPoints number three and five are the most interesting. My advice would be to look into the fields of journalism and the social sector/NGOs et cetera. The most important thing is networking with the people working or planning to work in this field. The easiest way to do that is to get a degree in this field. So, look into Asian College of Journalism, Symbiosis, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and JNU. Also, familiarise yourself with the top names in this field, both organisations and individuals. So, for example, if you want to work on the environment there is Centre for Science and Environment and Sunita Narain. If you want to do something in politics, there's Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Abhiyan. If you want to work on rural issues there's P Sainath and People's Archive of Rural India. There's also the Teach for India Fellowship which pays around 20K a month I believe and the deadline to submit applications for this year may still be open.

While dates are just markers of time, they also have a psychological effect, the transition in to something new. On the eve of a new decade, this is my message to my fellow friends.

Friends,

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention.I like your long term approach.

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

1310,[PSA] A Guide to Jobs in the field of Computer Science for Engineering Students in pre-final / final year,289,bggn06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/,52,"  

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",1556056371.0,"Good effort! Seems well researched.Nice guide. In addition to the mentioned things, product based companies ask puzzles and system design questions. Depending on the company you may be asked less about DS Algo and more about the domain in which they work. Like Adobe would ask you more about CPP and implementation of memory functions. Samsung deals more with graph questions.

Also, if you are from tier 1 college then product companies would also come for internship opportunities. The oncampus internship interviews are a little bit easy.I did a big mistakes of not studying properly in college. Now that I am graduating soon I have less than 60% and couldnt sit for placements 😞.

1311,Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,147,biwylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,56,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",1556613311.0,"[removed]I agree with you. There is life beyond, programming or JEE. Those one figured out way to deal with it, won't be asking questions here about options they have. We should engage more and give better solutions to young ones who are looking for the channels, avenues.

She wanted to get more information.

* It looks like *Chaitanya Institute of Technology* and Science was recently established (2010) and is not ranked in any listing. Any insights?
* How safe is Warangal for someone from African continent. I have seen posts about violence against Africans on this sub-reddit.
* What are the possibilities for him to transfer to a better educational institution after he starts in one educational institution?

She will be supporting him financially from her meagre income working as a barista at our cafeteria; so practical advice would be greatly appreciated by her. Thank you.",1566074684.0,"It's not ranked because it's just one among many other private universities in the country. I'm not aware of how much tuition fee they're charging but, if it's comparable to other well regarded private universities in the state, I'd suggest him to try for those. There's National Institute of Technology in Warangal, which is very well known and there you could find few students coming in from African nations and other foreign countries as well, probably to spend a semester or two there.

If you don't mind me asking, how did he come to know about that institution? He could've probably applied for universities in Hyderabad or any other metro city or even second tier city like Vijayawada, which isn't that far from Warangal. Cities are much safer because you can find someone from your own country(or neighborhood nations) there, studying in some other university. Better try for universities in Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad or any other tier two city in the south.


There are many private universities which do have good facilities and offer quality education, but be careful while choosing. There are probably like only 10% good ones, from among them all. SRM, GITAM are two private universities that I know of in my region. There are probably many such in metro cities but I don't know about any of them right now. Also, he could try applying for public universities, but then it's not gonna be easy. I'm not sure of his aptitude and STEM subject skills so I can't really suggest any public ones. But be sure to check them.


Violence against people of African origin does happen, but if he stays in the metro region and avoids traveling alone to remote areas in the country, he's safe and good. Also, it's better to get connected with students who  came from your country, as they'd be very able to guide you in a better way. I could only help you in suggesting whether the university that you opted for is regionally well known or not, but culturally adjusting is far more important. It'd help if someone you know is in or around that area.


Feel free to ask questions regarding universities or anything else. Hopefully, I can answer them as well.I used to live in Warangal. Many African students studied in NITW. I know of none who studied elsewhere. It was an okay experience for them.

Interestingly, I took an auto one day and an African guy was riding along. The auto driver tried to rip him off but the guy was having none of it. My guess is that these auto drivers try to rip them off any given chance. Other than that I think it was pretty okay for them. There is that subtle racism though, like impulsive mistrust. There's a very tiny African community. If he can get in contact with them, they can advise him on safety and stuff.

CIT is not a college for a foreign national to pursue education in. If the degree has value in Sudan then I guess it's okay but other than it, it's not of much use.

I'm not sure about the possibilities of transfer. He has to discuss that with the institute.",Science/Technology

## Tl;dr

The DNA Bill is back. The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18.  The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.

## What's it all about?

India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.

We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.

## A few of our very many concerns

* *No data protection legislative framework*: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
* *Profiling and surveillance:* DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance.
* *Overbroad provisions:* Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (**alarm bells are ringing**). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.

The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.

We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

https://preview.redd.it/nfpahf4632m21.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ffc8afca6b06ee2d8eae6a26267b616a03d157a

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

https://preview.redd.it/vk8zcbb4sio31.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81169a3f60ecc89d246db99901cf18b1024cabb

**24 September 2019:** In today's hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook's transfer petition seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.

On 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook's transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.

During today's hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and ""special suggestions"" were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.

The Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti's proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/).

After hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.

IFF's Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF's stance in today's hearing:

>""IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations.  
Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi.  This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers.  
Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon'ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon'ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed.    
Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.""

The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today's hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.

1317,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,13,ctzkd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,6,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",1566518998.0,"Oh man. My story is like 99% similar to yours. At least you had some group projects and stuff, all I had to go through was countless hours of theory just to pass the exams from the professor who didn’t knew shit what they were even talking about.

I just didn’t give a shit anymore, stopped eating properly stopped going out, stop exercising. Started to loose interest in everything I did even the things I used to like, programming. No wonder I dropped out of engineering.I agree dude, the whole system is ass here. I went abroad for all my education even after I cracked JEE because I knew I would be able to actually grow as a person out there. College should help people mature and grow instead of just forcing an education. They don’t treat you like an adult or give you any freedoms here. I remember my first day in a dorm and I asked the RAs if there are any restrictions on what time I can be out and they were like you can go out wherever you want. If you go talk to an advisor about your interest or careers they genuinely talk about it and help you find classes, clubs, minors or even help switch your major. They treat you like an adult and let you make your own choices everywhere else. Over here it’s all about cramming information into you and getting you a shitty job.Hi Mate,
I pretty much agree with most of what you said.

1318,[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],35,c87jbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/,13,"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

Below quote is from [The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ](http://www.fao.org/fall-armyworm/en/)

>The Fall Armyworm (FAW), or Spodoptera frugiperda, is an insect that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In the absence of natural control or good management, it can cause significant damage to crops. It prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 additional species of crops, including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton. **FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and has quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018 it was confirmed in India and Yemen**.

2 **DownToEarth.org has studied and covered the FAW effects in India** - [Article here](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/agriculture/fall-armyworm-attack-the-damage-done-63445)

(*DownToEarth is an fortnightly magazine, produced by an India based NGO Centre for Science and Environment*)

> * By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop. 

> * Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

> * In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. **Pesticides are not effective on them**,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

> * In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states

> * Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. 

> * **Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.**


> * In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. **“With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production**,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.

It's the equivalent of saying that professional scientists of NASA or NCAR aren't real scientists as they are not Professors. Unlike the latter whose career depends upon impact factors and finding, career scientists have more security and a more focused domain. Creating a new satellite or any stuff doesn't mean that they are copy pasting or just scaling a design like lego builders; it involves applied science, hundreds or thousands developing new materials, better fuel options, better heat dissipation, structural design, aerodynamics, control systems and all sorta works.

The college I studied in was tier three college so good companies don't visit our campus. I had offers from TCS, Wipro etc but TCS was the best in all the worst companies I had offers from so I joined it. The salary I get is also very low (3.5lpa), also I have a service agreement of an year there.

I'm very much confused about my future as to what I should do next, I don't want to work there. I need a good salary. So should I get better at competitive programming and let companies contact me or should I get decent in DS, Algos, give eLitmus and let companies contact me?

Never be discouraged by the achievements of your gf/spouse. They need your encouragement not jealousy.

Also, please don't be depressed. Most engineers start their career at tcs and the like. Build up from here. At worst you are on the same path as most engineering gradsYou need to pass 2-3 years in TCS. It will be difficult but doable. You need the experience number. Believe me, TCS experience holds good value in the market. Meanwhile, pick a technology that you like and learn it thoroughly in your personal time. TCS provides plenty of premium learning resources. Try to do 1-2 projects on that. Then start giving interviews on the tech that you learnt. TCS does not mention the platform you worked on in the company on their experience letter, so you can lie on your resume. You might have to give multiple interviews before you get selected but every setback helps to be better. Also interview everywhere even in companies that you have never heard of.

Also it is better to learn a technology where there are less people on that skill set available in the market. That is a great advantage as it is easier to get a good job with knowledge of say Big Data when compared to Java.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

I'd say you're off to a pretty good start! Keep working on those Data Structure & Algorithms skills, you will really require them going forward! Especially in big companies, they'll ask you to solve one of those questions on a whiteboard/google doc as interviews.

\> ML and Data science requires more math

You're right about this. Have you given that math a shot though? You may like it, you may not, you could check it out for yourself. A master's degree with an AI/ML specialization would be helpful if you wish to enter this field

1328,Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,38,bn13id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bn13id/need_for_a_change_of_school_culture_and_the_hype/,8,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

But when it came to me, it was get marks or die. 

I think part of the problem is that in India there are so few means of evaluating a person beyond their marks. When applying to US universities, you have to write essays, jot down your clubs and extra-curricular activities, the interview will focus on the things you spend time on outside the classroom etc. The marks themselves are just the bare minimum. I feel in India the marks are supreme. I bet the entrance exam culture doesn’t help either.

It also sucks that there are so few premier institutions in India to study at, relative to our population. The US has flagship state colleges in every state, and at least 2 or 3 other unis that are fairly good, not to mention private world-class unis like Stanford and Harvard etc. We needs more high-quality institutes of higher learning, spread out throughout the country.The way they hype the importance of 10th board exams is sad.

I am just acknowledging the wide gap. 

Today I woke up to a tweet by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad which showed a robot called Mitra made by an Indian company. The robot looked amusingly simple, like a bigger version of the toys I had as a child. See it here: 

> Nice to meet Mitra- the robot during Goa IT day that has been developed by an Indian startup. #DigitalIndia

> https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1018473949229826048?s=09

I was intrigued and searched for it. I came across this video which shows the same robot greeting Ivanka Trump when she visited India. The robot enters with drumbeats:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_irZMn5JeB0

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press. It kind of failed the second task because the maker did not think the process through (PM and Ivanka both press the button together and it got stuck on the next screen). This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

I studied in an NIT and the MTech students were treated very poorly and had to fight for even the most basic infrastructure. Mitra was brought to my college. The mechanics, computer vision and the actual neural network all clearly looked terrible. 

It was no more a robot than a shitty little chinese  toy. It moved slowly (on wheels). It was capable of asking pre fed questions. It honestly looked like a remote controlled moving computer screen.

I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

Hard to tell as this depends on entire profile. But, At least 700+ for Indian men.

>4) Can appearing multiple times for GMAT have repurcussions? (except the ones incurred by pocket)

No. Most schools take highest score.

>5) What is lumpsum figure for fee (can he can expect to be offered scholarship based on GMAT score)

Tuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years. Likelihood of scholarship in top 20 schools is very low based on your profile. If you go below top 20 schools, you may get a scholarship based on GMAT, but you may not get a job.

>6) He is a merchandiser and has been in this industry for 3 years. He has worked for one start up also(pretty crucial role), can leaving his current job for 2-3 months for preparation have negative impact? (in terms of Recommendation letter, Work experience etc.)

Depends on the rapport with the person who will give recommendation letter. Small gaps won't likely have huge impact on application. But three years of overall experience is very low for US b-schools where the median is 5 years and for Indian applicants, it's likely around 7-8 years.

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes...

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

Although I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.

1351,I hate summers!,11,9c4cu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9c4cu9/i_hate_summers/,21,"Disclaimer: My previous post was removed, reason looked more like an excuse and my appeal wasn't answered. Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression.

Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",1550817361.0,[deleted],Science/Technology
1353,Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,6,9xldhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/,9,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",1542396558.0,"> the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless.

Gone are the days when you could curl up with a yashwant kanetkar C++ book and feel intelligent by proxy. Learning now has to be more chaotic - going back and forth between hands-on trials and theory. Who would want to begin with syntax and shit every single time.

I don't think an offline hard copy is feasible for as fluid a field as computer science. Textbooks are a racket even in USA.

Besides, computer Science and programming is not like physics or chemistry or biology where you can really benefit from a book. In those areas, the information is much more established and unchanging (or slowly changing).

HeadFirst series of books present info in an interesting way. But it can appear childish after 1 book. An online wiki is much more helpful. Or an ebook. Education has to evolve, like any other field. Indian education system is still somewhere in the 70's. Absolute disregard for technology and still relying on dictation+ rote learning instead of providing a platform for students to develop their own individual skillsets. 

Trying to change it from within is quite futile. I'd say get out on time, do your 5 years of boring company work, then if you still feel strongly about it, innovate. Your current idea is very shortsighted, kind of a means to an end, which is what the industry terms ""a hack"".  You are relying on a non-existent community to collaborate and contribute to something, for which they have no motivation or incentive. 

Why not start a class forum or maybe a discord/slack group instead? Create a community on that, and let it grow over a semester. Recruit the people who are active there and think of a better solution.Sounds intriguing but hardly anything worthwhile can be covered in 100 pages, it won't be any different from a really good set of notes. The best books/teachers in my opinion explore the basics very deeply, they explore the shortcomings of previous theorems/algorithms/models leading to advanced theorems/algorithms/models.

Your qualms with the education system do hold true but don't just worry about clearing exams, find a subject area you are really interested in, explore and build an expertise around that.

If you could create a community driven platform where subject experts agree to mentor people looking for in-depth knowledge, that will be more valuable.",Science/Technology

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries.
(Image: PIB)

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India’s first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR’s Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

“CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,” a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: “Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.”

The indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime
Minister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean
energy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.

“It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,” said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi’s vision of “Make
in India” to turn the country into ” a manufacturing hub and to cut down
outflow of foreign exchange.”

As per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil
Nadu’s Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to
bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace
the Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for
solar rooftop with life span of 25 years.

“We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per
KW to replace Lead Acid Battery…“We also have plans to make Lithium Ion
battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable
enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,” Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing
Director C Narsimhan said.

Why Lithium-Ion batteries:

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid
to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles
(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid
Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and
Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.

Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of
physical wires-means wireless.

Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated.

1360,We really need to talk about Flairs.,104,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",1494883276.0,"Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest.

Which branch you’re in? You can still move to pure sciences, lot of people have done it. For example, if you are in CS/IT, you can go for a masters in Statistics or Applied mathematics or Financial mathematics. All have good scope. Stats or applied maths will get you a great career in data science. Financial mathematics can get you a career in HFT firms or others as Quantitative Analyst but it’s tough to get into, you have to be really good at your maths.

If you are in other branches also, these fields are open. Applied physics is also good for niche careers especially if you have mech background.

""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts.

1369,I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,22,8rsrvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rsrvc/i_am_planning_a_new_digital_learning_initiative_i/,12,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

The title is clickbait-y but who gives a crap if a pundit can tell you when the eclipse is? Why does it matter. 

>""Our saints had said that earth existed 1.96 arab (billion) years ago. Earlier, science did not accept this but later it had to. What they tell is run by our channels. They should have asked Pundits,"" he said praising ancient Indian knowledge.

Just a simple google search shows that the age of Earth is ~4.5 billion years old. That's why science didn't accept it. Do speechwriters even fact check?

>Stating that no other country possesses the knowledge, which India has, Rajnath Singh said be it theorems of trigonometry, algebra or others no other country could match our knowledge.

I think anyone with a math textbook can match our knowledge. It's not some closely guarded secret. If he's talking about historically, then it's out of my area of knowledge.

Uhh what? I think history has shown that, people who stick to their ""traditions"" instead of adapting to a changing world, are the ones who die out.

When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** 

 ______ 
** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **

The recent suggestion by

RV Deshpande

, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure
development, that

Bengaluru

be given the status of a second capital of

India

has sparked off an interesting debate.

For a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a
compelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that
Deshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.

The concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across
the world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the
Netherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals — Bloemfontein,
Cape Town, and Pretoria — that house its judicial, legislative and executive
branches.

Bengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status
as the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our
scientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.

Bengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs
to invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,
industry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of
the S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,
world-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.

The information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong
entrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the ""Science
Capital"", ""Startup Capital"", ""IT Capital"" and ""Biotechnology Capital"" of the
country.

By proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the
administrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to
have a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi
and Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's
Knowledge Capital.

The city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the
evolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India
to leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for
implementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related
ministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit
immensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the
government in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.

The success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the
Department of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of
science &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in
Bengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can
lead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can
benefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the
city as the data science hub of the country.

As India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India
towards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and
participatory policy-making through the government's

Digital India

initiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a
redress of issues and policymaking.

As a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden
of governance through greater expediency and efficiency.

By giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the
Indian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative
S&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a
very integral part of the country.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030—announced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week—is a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.

India has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world’s most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions—but that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.

Only time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government’s plans and priorities.

First is the government’s focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.

A human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.

The situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.

The second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.

Another example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government’s flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.

Against this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series—and can be seen as part of the government’s larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself—as Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize—will not be enough.

1379,Rant: Are we condemned to being ignorant?,234,4uz3ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uz3ms/rant_are_we_condemned_to_being_ignorant/,121,"I've been wanting to write this for a *long* time but somehow haven't been able to make time to sit and pen it down. This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

1385,"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",129,7dkd0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dkd0z/how_an_ambulance_rushed_through_500_kilometers_of/,15,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

With the global economy yet to recover from the 2008 economic crisis, concern about the future— especially of advanced economies—is intensifying. My Northwestern University colleague Robert J. Gordon captures the sentiment, arguing in his recent book, The Rise And Fall Of American Growth that the productivity enhancing innovations of the last century and a half cannot be equaled. If true, advanced economies should expect slow growth and stagnation in the coming years. But will the future really be so bleak?

Probably not. Pessimism has reigned over economists’ outlooks for centuries. In 1830, the British Whig historian Thomas Macaulay observed that, “(i)n every age, everybody knows that up to his own time, progressive improvement has been taking place; nobody seems to reckon on any improvement in the next generation.” Why, he asked, do people expect “nothing but deterioration”? Macaulay’s perspective was vindicated by the dawn of the railway age. Transformative advances in steel, chemicals, electricity, and engineering followed.

When it comes to our technological future, I expect a similar outcome. Indeed, I’d go so far as to say, “We ain’t seen nothin’ yet.” My optimism is based not on some generalized faith in the future, but on the way science (or “propositional knowledge”) and technology (“prescriptive knowledge”) support each other. Just as scientific breakthroughs can facilitate technological innovation, technological advances enable scientific discovery, which drives more technological change. In other words, there is a positive feedback loop between scientific and technological progress.

The history of technology is full of examples of this feedback loop. The 17th century scientific revolution was made possible partly by new, technologically advanced tools, such as telescopes, barometers and vacuum pumps. One cannot discuss the emergence of germ theory in the 1870s without mentioning prior improvements in the microscope. The techniques of X-ray crystallography used by Rosalind Franklin were critical to the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as to discoveries that led to over 20 Nobel prizes.

The instruments available to science today include modern versions of old tools that would have been unimaginable even a quarter-century ago. Telescopes have been shot into space and connected to high-powered adaptive-optics computers to reveal a universe quite different from the one humans once imagined. In 2014, the builders of the Betzig-Hell microscope were awarded a Nobel Prize for overcoming an obstacle that had been considered insurmountable, bringing optical microscopy into the nanodimension.

Consider the revolutionary instruments and tools that have emerged in recent years. Start with the computer. Economists have made valiant efforts to assess computers’ impact on the production of goods and services, and to measure their contribution to productivity. But none can adequately account for the opportunities computers have created for scientific research.

There is no lab in the world that does not rely on them. The term “in silico” has taken its place next to “in vivo” and “in vitro” in experimental work. And entire new fields such as “computational physics” and “computational biology” have sprung up ex nihilo. In line with Moore’s Law, advances in scientific computation will continue to accelerate for many years to come, not least owing to the advent of quantum computing.

Another new tool is the laser. When the first lasers appeared, they were almost an invention in search of an application. Nowadays, they are almost as ubiquitous as computers, used for seemingly mundane daily uses from document scanning to ophthalmology. The range of research areas that now rely on lasers is no less broad, running the gamut of biology, chemistry, genetics, and astronomy. Recently, lasers enabled the confirmation of gravitational waves—one of the holy grails of physics.

Yet another technological innovation that is transforming science is the gene-editing tool CRISPR Cas9. Already, sequencing genomes is a fast and relatively cheap process, its cost having dropped from $10 million per genome in 2007 to under $1,000 today. CRISPR Cas9 takes this technology to a new level, as it enables scientists to edit and manipulate the human genome. While that idea may give some people pause, the technology’s potential beneficial applications —such as enabling essential crops to withstand climate change and water salination—cannot be overestimated.

Furthermore, digitization has lowered access costs for researchers substantially. All research relies on access to existing knowledge; we all stand on the shoulders of the giants (and even average-size figures) who came before us. But, until recently, learning what one needed to know to come up with scientific and technological innovations took a lot more work, with countless hours spent scouring libraries and encyclopedia volumes. Nowadays, researchers can access mega databases, where they can find patterns and empirical regularities.

Our scientific knowledge is surging forward, leading to innumerable new applications. Technology will forge ahead as well, in scores of expected and unexpected areas. It will bring economic growth, albeit perhaps not the kind that will register fully if we continue to rely on our outdated standards for national income accounting.

I did not study in IIT but from a deemed university (DAIICT) . This college was started by Dhirubhai Ambani , now part of Anil Ambani empire. We have humanity/design/communications course atleast one per each semester. We learnt about Gandhi, we learnt about how science evolved in India and its history, we learnt about environment, we learnt about politics, we learnt about management, we learnt about nomadic tribes, we learnt about various philosophies , we watched Sci fi movies as part of a course ,we learnt about how to build better buildings, we learnt about venture capitalism where such word was not even in Indian dictionary. Some of our seniors studied Anthropology. My one semester project was to analyse Telangana separate state agitation and provide the best roadmap ahead . we were studying ICT something related to IT and communications.

I would have been glad to take a Sanskrit course discussing ancient Indian literature, or take a proper history lesson.

One of my junior blogpost : http://blog.darshshah.org/2015/10/humanities-study-at-daiict.html

The point is : 4 years of Btech (esp in hostel campuses)  removes your worldly view when it is most needed . This is the age where you should not restrict yourself to learning one thing. Many people are not self learners and self motivators, but they have to better engineers. 

A better engineer is the one who understands not only to solutions better but also build better and right solutions.",Science/Technology
1393,"Universities must have more academic freedom, autonomy, says PM Narendra Modi",31,2r7wrb,http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/universities-must-have-more-academic-freedom-autonomy-says-pm-narendra-modi/1/214202.html,14,,1420336834.0,">**""We want our scientists to explore the mysteries of science and not of government procedure,""** Modi said, while inaugurating the 102nd Indian Science Congress in Mumbai.
""Our institutions of research must become more broad based. Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,"" Modi said.
**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

> ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

>""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&
 
>""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&

>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&

> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

Rest pages talks about guidelines for institutions and their eligibility criteria.",1476020233.0,"You can't appoint political stooges to head institutions and then expect them to be world class or ask them to waste funds on a unnecessary flags.

Stop interfering with Universities make them autonomous, have real academicians head them and you will have World Class institutes. All the best universities we have are because they have been autonomous.A world class institution isn't it buildings, syllabuses, structure, facilities, courses, brand or history. A world class institution is its faculty.

Start small with a few courses. 20 institutions, 20 teachers each. Make a list of the 400 best Indian teachers in the world. Do whatever you can to get them to commit 4 years to teaching them in India. And give them full autonomy over everything - courses, syllabus, staff, what facilities they spend money on, mess food vendor, everything. 

Having committees, criterias, monitoring and all other bureaucratic nonsense will just lead to average institutions by virtue of the law of averages.",Science/Technology

  By Amit Kapoor  

 

  A special ""Nobel Series"" session was a notable addition at the latest Vibrant Gujarat Summit (January 9-12).  

 

  Nine laureates were invited to share their thoughts about the challenges of humankind and what could be done to alleviate them. A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  

 

  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  

 

  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of ""institutions"" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  

 

  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the ""creative class"" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. ""Creative class"", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  

 

  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  

 

  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  

 

  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  

 

  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  

 

  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's ""Creative Class"". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  

 

  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  

 

  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  

 

  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  

 

  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.

1396,Is Indian Meteorological Department really incompetent?,47,6z9gmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z9gmn/is_indian_meteorological_department_really/,15,"This is an excerpt from D Sivananda Pai's (Head of climate prediction at IMD) interview published in Indian Express.
[Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/meteorological-predictions-are-not-perfect-we-never-claim-that-it-is-a-science-we-do-our-best-d-sivananda-pai-imd/) 


**On unreliable forecasts from IMD**
>- I admit that meteorological predictions are not perfect. We never claim that we are 100 per cent right. It is a science and we do the best we can. 
- Rainfall is never equally distributed throughout the city. So, generally, forecasting the exact rainfall value over a particular location is not possible. For eg. in case of recent rains in Mumbai, the regional variation was so high that within the city itself, Dharavi recorded 56 cm of rainfall, Santacruz 33 cm and Colaba about 10 cm 
- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.

1397,"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",217,6esgm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/,11,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",1496409982.0,"TRAI is the only one who thinks public opinion matters in indiaIt seems this paper only talks about wireless plans, but I see something very disturbing in wired plans (especially of local ISPs) these days.

These guys promise 50/100 Mbps, and you do get the advertised speed upto their gateway. But speeds to actual servers on the internet are highly varied - domestic servers and those with a peering agreement perform very well but random websites do not.

Given that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity.

This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.

Edit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour!Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It’s a cultural thing. 

In older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

These days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.

Another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

> New Delhi:

> From videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting Muslims are immune to coronavirus, the Delhi Police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government's efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic.

> In an investigation of the content being shared on WhatsApp and apps like TikTok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the Delhi Police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the Muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> An analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in Hindi and Urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> The videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by NDTV. According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.

> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.

> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.

> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh's Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.

> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims"".

> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.

> ""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places. This is not against the principles of Islam,"" he said.

> While at around 2,000 cases and 53 deaths, the spread of coronavirus in India is far more limited than in Europe and the US, health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root.https://www.altnews.in/old-unrelated-video-shared-as-muslims-licking-utensils-to-spread-coronavirus-infection/

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",1585485942.0,"""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phraseFeel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one. It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended.

* Take a white fish and fillet it.
* Brush the side with beaten eggs
* Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
* flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
* Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

* Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
* After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

* In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
* Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
* add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
* mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
* add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
* bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

* Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
* place fried fish
* use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
* garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:

Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

* Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.That looks fantastic! It's got me in the mood for a second lunch",Food

But an average Indian currently in Australia is much worse off than an aussie. 

While many less wealthy countries are doing the right thing, Australia is doing its best not to look after the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders. So government has no responsibility. 

In contrast to this, all foreigners in Portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from Monday until at least July 1, this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak. 

Applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify, granting them access to the national health service, welfare benefits, etc. Temporary residents in Australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many don't have health insurance. 


Our own temporary visa holders in Australia won't be getting any benefit from their government. While Aussie citizens and PR holders will be entitled to receive benefits, many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation, will now be asked to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window, for example recently Australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week, as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for Aussies.

I am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example Adelaide, where some Indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobs.

On top of that, many people who came to India on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months, Australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months, yes it only applied to temporary visas. Doesn't matter if you are living there from last 5-10 years. 

Now these people are stuck in India and many have lost their dream of getting residency, what's worse is they can't even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings, say their goodbyes. The government refuses to extend the deadline on their entry due to no fault of their own because they are visa holders and not Australians.

Updating as he's speaking

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""
10. If we won't behave in these 21 days of lockdown, it could result into a setback of 21 years.
11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.
15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.
18. PLEASE Don't take any medicines before you consult any doctor at any cost, it could be fatal.
19. Take care of your family, The only way we can get through this is by maintaining this lockdown
20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL.[deleted]",Food

Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",1585260863.0,">drinking warm water or hot water

This is a myth. we are warm blooded animal.(Homeostasis) 

>milk with turmeric

turmeric has anti microbial property .

>About gargling.

Gargling works on a simple phenomenon i.e plasmolysis but do remember to add salt..otherwise gargling is useless.

>Vit C

Yes its good for immunity. But regular and gradual intake of VIt C helps in enhancing immunity.My dad isn't letting me keep water in the fridge.

1. In Karnataka, tonnes of grapes have found their way to compost pits amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees.
2. Next week the harvest season will begin for India’s most staple wheat crop. In all probability, shortage of hands for harvesting wheat could lead to rotting of the crop in the fields. 
3. In France, acute shortage of seasonal labour to harvest crops has prompted the government call unemployed to help farmers.
4. In the US, the virus has sent farm workers, half of whom are undocumented migrant labourers, uncovered by $2 trillion stimulus, into panic

The government has so far given a welfare relief of only Rs 1.7 lakh crore, which is just about 1.2% of GDP and that too largely for formal sector workers. The informal sector, which constitutes about 80% of the country’s workforce,  is yet to get any relief

Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet.

From the indus Valley time's  lothal port to trading with Africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.

In order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won't spoil easily. This is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part",1581982096.0,"But, by that logic shouldn't odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far East.Now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. It's based on my mother and my grandmother's account of her childhood.

Basically, Gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. Pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. Back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. Groundnut was another crop. So you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. Oil used is also the same while much of North India used sarson.. (which is non existent in Gujarat, btw). White rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. Earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (My mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) Most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in South Gujarat). In Saurashtra, it would be bajra. Again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (May be post 70s). 

My grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. For most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) Sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. No green veggies for summer. So you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that's what was available. 

Actually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and Maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. The super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (I remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won't get anything...it's consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  Also, they are not limited to Gujarat only. Even South has its variant of ""murukku"". The Gujarati or rather Central Indian snacks became more famous recently because of Haldiram maybe? Even the ""murmura"" snacks are common in much of India. 

But yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. Though that has to do with our ""save money for 1 meal"" tendency plus ""won't find vegetarian food"" problem. Don't think it has much to do with the seafarers. They probably had an abundance of macchi from the Arabian sea on their way to Africa.This is the state of affairs. The OP posted a theory based on Geopolitics about Food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the OP or Gujaratis. 

About the theory, quite plausible. It is often the case that even today Gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. This is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as Farsan (not just Gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. 
But that's just my perspective, I am sure you will find some research about it.

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",1585678744.0,"[deleted]I didn't read the whole thing through, so pardon me if I misunderstood it but there are some ground realities that's being ignored.

First, flu doesn't affect the whole population in a short period of time. Its infection is spread out in a longer period of time so that it doesn't overwhelmed healthcare facilities. So those infected can get proper treatment. It's also less lethal and less contagious.

Second, anybody could fall sick or get into a situation that requires medical help but wouldn't be able to because hospitals are filled with Covid-19 patients. And this would increase deaths from other causes. Pregnant mothers too aren't able to get medical assistance as a result.

Third, we don't yet know the long term implications of Covid-19. Death isn't the only thing that we should be concern about a disease. Will any tissues or organs be impaired permanently? Do those who recovered become fully fit and healthy?",Food

A major chunk of the food packets was distributed at homes using a group of volunteers put together solely for this purpose. When there were cases of ineligible persons misusing community kitchens, LSGD gave fresh instructions to prioritize food distribution to the needy ones. A total of 44,033 lunch packets were given at Rs 20 per meal in four days till April 8 and free food was given to 1.03 lakh needy persons through Janakeeya hotels.

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",1587240047.0,"Bhai, correlation is not causation. Education plays a bigger role with religiosity.

India theoretically has a public healthcare system AND social security. The quality and accessibility is another thing, of courseMy first impulse is to agree.

But on second thoughts, is this really true? Lots of Muslim majority countries have universal free healthcare. Tunisia for example. That didn’t stop them from being an Islamic State hotbed. Saudi Arabia? The less said the better. Bangladesh, our neighbor has a very robust public health system. And yet, it’s secularism is little more than a fake veneer. Majoritarianism is open and out there for anyone to see.

More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them. 

Please think  again, if you think my thoughts have political origin.",1585357634.0,"I absolutely see the need for this lockdown. If we don't, this disease will spread unchecked and kill _a lot_ of people, mostly these poor guys who are already malnourished and living in horrid conditions.  

_But_ the government should have first implemented a system where there are daily or weekly food deliveries to the poor. We can't let them just starve. Additionally they should have implemented a freeze on rent payments or a government subsidy for those landlords so the poor aren't burdened with it. Food, water and shelter should have first been guaranteed by the government _before_ the lockdown. 

As for allowing them to go home before the lockdown, that is not at all wise. Because of the inadequate testing done by the government we don't know the extent of the spread within cities. We're fairly confident the spread is limited in rural areas though but even that isnt 100% certain, because again, we're not testing nearly as much as we should. 

But allowing mass migration of millions of people from urban to rural is a good way to make sure this virus spreads rapidly among India's impoverished rural population. And mark you, the healthcare infrastructure in rural India is woefully inadequate. We're already going to struggle with the overstretched healthcare facilities in cities. Rural India isn't even close to being prepared for this. Look at how it's ravaging Italy and the US. Imagine the damage it will do here where our healthcare facilities are inadequate in the best of times, where we have high population density, poverty and malnourishment. 

This isn't just a pandemic anymore it's atleast two disasters rolled into one. We're going to see massive unemployment, we're going to see a lot of businesses, big and small, failing. We're going to see a global economic depression not seen since 1929 and maybe even worse than that. And if this disease gets _really_ bad we're going to start seeing a breakdown of our food production and distribution because the poor that grow our food will be sick or dying in droves. Which means, in India alone, millions of deaths from famine, food riots in cities and a possible breakdown of law and order. Of course, this is a worst case scenario and hopefully things won't get so bad but preventing that means we need to take this virus _very seriously_. 

So if the government is finally taking extreme measures to slow the spread then yeah I support it. I don't support the fact they did not account for the well being of the poor before doing this, which they should have. But this lockdown...it's necessary. 

Look, If we're looking at this realistically, there is no 'flattening the curve' for India. The window for that has passed. Cases will spike and it will overwhelm our healthcare system. People are going to die because there won't be enough ICU beds or enough ventilators. The only thing this lockdown will achieve in my opinion is that it will delay that spike, buying the government crucial time to acquire or manufacture more PPE, ventilators and beds. At the very least they can try to raise the bar on the capacity of our healthcare infrastructure so that fewer people die. The government should have started preparing two months ago, we should have converted factories to manufacture PPE and ventilators back then. But like most governments the world over, they were slow to react. And the price for that early inaction is we go into lockdown now. The choice is being in lockdown now or having thousands more preventable deaths later. Neither are good choices but no one has the luxury of good choices anymore in a global disaster of this magnitude. That's the reality the world over and we need to adapt to this because if we don't _people will die_. 

Guys, we are in uncharted waters here. Every country on this planet will have to take _extreme_ measures to prevent massive loss of life. This is the defining disaster of our time. Even the 1918 pandemic or the world wars did not shut down the world like this has. We do not have history to learn from because this has _never happened before_.I've come back home after a fairly long time and have duly switched my parents' evening diet from Tez to NDTV.

Since then, I only had Indian food, mostly street food and cheap restaurants. I'm already getting used to the spiciness unlike at the beginning.

Two days ago I started having acute upper back pain between my shoulder blades. Pain when turning neck, especially downwards. Feeling of being ""stuck"". I'm personally thinking I got a bad knot from sleeping in a weird position + poor posture.

Now, everybody has different unprofessional diagnosis and advice for that kinda thing; muscle sprain, pulled, knot. The most original I've heard is that all the spices somehow build up gas that can get stuck in the back; should go away over a few days or with a muscle relaxant. Apparently that would be a pretty common phenomenon in India, including amongst Indians themselves. To me that sounds pretty pseudoscience, can't any source about it anyway.

2.) If have access to a refrigerator - make ice in bulk, make an ice bath - dip a nice cotton bed sheet in it. Before sleeping just  hang up this sheet near a window or curtain rod. Provides a little respite from heat  - we used to do it a lot in Chennai where we had no access to AC and heat was much worse ! 

3.) Try not to let hot air seep in during day time in the rooms. Ventilate it after sun down & use proper shades for rooms during day to keep it cool.

4.) As suggested in other comments - a cool shower just before sleeping also works wonders !

But what bullshit. The paper is a collection of random unsupported assertions, quotes from popular/recipe books, and assertions that Rasam has traditionally been used for one purpose of the other. I was hoping to see proof, but who needs proof when assertions are  sufficient.

Here is a quick sample:

""However, the concept of “*Unavae marunthu*” is at least 3500 years before Hippocrates (460–370 BCE)."" - At a minimum, the author should support with citation. But it is easier to assert about things that happened 1,500 BC than to cite!

""Rani and Paulraj, 2013, have reported that blood iron profile {snip} in anemic  patients was greatly influenced by dietary intervention with the  functional food Spirulina incorporated in *rasam*.\[[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628526/#ref31)\]"" -- Sure, spirulina (which is a cyanobacteria) is rich in iron. Rasam has little to do with it, orange juice will do just as well, because it is about as acidic. And traditionally or otherwise, nobody adds cyanobacteria to rasam!

""A significant antimicrobial activity of *rasam* against *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Bacillus subtilis*, *Klebsiella Pneumoniae*, and *Escherichia coli* has been reported.\[[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628526/#ref36)\]"" -- This is a lie. The cited article talks about some other 'chooranam'. The link is supposedly that some of the constituents of that chooranam are also present in rasam. The reference says nothing about antimicrobial activity of rasam, as the authors claim! Lying buggers.

Educated people here, tell me..",1585113982.0,"I tried doing the sane thing of not going out for the last 2 weeks.
For the entire 2 weeks was not able to get basic things on a daily basis like milk, bread eggs.
Ordered through bigbasket and to my surprise they cancelled the order after I waited for it for 1 whole week.

Today I finally gave up and went out to buy groceries and ended up coming in contact with at least 20 people.I hope you've things for few days.  This is a massive undertaking by the govt for which our country sure as hell wasn't prepared for ever. Nor does our govt knows what they are doing right now. There was no plan in place ever for this. So give them a few days. As always our govt is few days late with taking the right decision. So for now hang in there, 2-3 days later I am hoping they will get their shit together and understand the gravity of doing this so haphazardly, once they understand that they will get the daily essentials everywhere in a more streamlined fashion. 

So with that mindset, let me answer your queries in ways that seem logical to me.

1 You are allowed to go outside but not to roam about, police are told to let people go to stores and buy things. Just make sure you have a list and don't go to store to think and then decide. Try going to the closest store for things.

2 Ya people will hoard things, they already have.9pm to 12am last night people did that unnecessarily. But just understand this, these people will not come out again for the next 2 weeks at least. This means whatever comes in the next 3-4 days for the days upto the lockdown will be available for everyone. Yes, these will get out of stock quickly but be smart and buy for 2-3 days when you go out not much.  Its also the time to make creative and unorthodox meals from things you already have. It's the time to be socially responsible. One less milk pack you buy is a liter of milk for a family of 3. 

3 As announced essential goods will be available, factories and manufacturing units are allowed to be kept working if they make essential goods. Logistics supplying that is allowed to keep working. Ecommerce delivery is officially allowed so bigbasket etc should be able to get their shit sorted (but don't rely on them, buy local whenever you can). Some States even announced that police will help these trucks reach their destination. 

4 That crowd is going to be a problem at stores. Try going to stores close to you so you can rush back home and avoid crowds or people in general. Not the time to chit chat in person. You try your best to keep social distance. If you see a crowd gathered at stores, police are patrolling, call them and request them to force this crowd to obey social distancing. Thats the most you can do, I would recommend going out at times like 1-2pm when not many people will come out. Most people will come out a few hours before they know they want food. So less crowd hopefully. 

As soon as you come out clean up properly, hands, face, feet. Better yet take a good soapy shower. Clean your door knobs, doors, vehicle and all your contact points. Wash your bags when you get home. Take necessary precaution and you should be fine. This is the time to be paranoid but in a more rational way and not too much that it destroys your mental peace. Goood luck, take care and stay safe. Hang in there, don't panic.

1. chemotherapy side effects will vary with every person. 

Common side effects include nausea, hair loss, neuropathy and general weakness in body. 

Some of these side effects can be managed, and managed well with the kind of medication available now. 

Diet is going to play a major role. The days immediately after chemo, her mouth will have possible ulcers, her taste buds will go hay wire. Try and check with her, her comfort levels with respect to food. 

For my mom, we started the day with tender coconut water. Its one of the best when it comes to providing energy and soothing to the stomach. The jelly like coconut, very early stage is also in our experience good for the ulcers in mouth. 

Pomegranate juice was another near constant in my moms diet. 


Her platelet count will take a dive. So check with you doc for papaya leaf extract as a fall back. 

Greens like drum stick leaves also helped. 


If she does have hair fall, consider getting her a nice wig. It helps a lot psychologically. 

Above all, just give her the confidence that you are all there. Cancer treatment, especially Chemo is a very psychologically taxing regimen. You need every ounce of mental strength to get through it.

I hope you don't mind me posting this here for some advice! I'm a teacher from Sydney, Australia and I've just started my own online business. I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families.

1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)",1578598858.0,"It really depends on who your target audience is. Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month. But they'll probably form a minority, compared to the total number of students in India. Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending. [To give you an anecdote about spending, Spotify gives student memberships at 60 rupees a month, and all my urban friends think it's a really good deal, while a lot of my small town friends still prefer to pirate it for free.]


But at the same time if the product is worth it, Indian parents are a sucker for anything education related. But you'll have to work hard to establish that trust.  You can have a look at BYJU's - they do a lot of teaching online and they've gotten loads of funding.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything!

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

1604,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",2,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",1569445691.0,,Business/Finance

1608,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",390,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,56,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",1586098195.0,"I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination.",Business/Finance

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies.

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",1587316954.0,">Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.


Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.


I like your interesting take on Mamata where you've conveniently ignored the following:


1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn't bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There's too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. 


2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. 


3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what's she's doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that's not bjp propaganda. I'm receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there's state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there's co-morbid conditions, you'll not even die from covid, that doesn't mean it's not spreading.


4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state's industrial output? Where are the jobs? We've all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?


5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn't have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn't get to decide who gets citizenship. We don't want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?


There's no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she's just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal's industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That's all there is to it.


Bengali's have no hope left. It's TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that's probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali's are leaving the state, who's gonna rise to the occasion?There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.

1611,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,4,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,15,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

1612,"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.",0,g4s5yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4s5yd/indian_govt_banning_investment_from_china_is_yet/,13,"Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",1587415734.0,"China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India's protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely.> Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket 

These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don't want that. 

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company.> Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines? If startups don't learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet.",Business/Finance
1613,Here's my side of the story as a small businessman,27,fw7gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,6,"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",1586237386.0,"i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",1586706844.0,"I said you, Do not test waters again and again specially at the time of your career start. I did this and almost wasted my 2 years and still don't know where to go forward to, I did my MBA in 2017 in marketing and IT field then I was doing job as a Business Development Executive for around 6 month, I don't know what but after that I fight for SSC for hard 2 years but I just appeared for once in that exam as the other one got postponed back in 2018.

Now, I totally dropped that Idea but meanwhile SSC prepration I do some freelance marketing pipeline models for businesses and small firms. I did Advertisement assesment job in between on contract. 

I was also a CA IPCC dropped out as I can still do Articleship but I didn't want to go to that domain now. 

Now, I planned to do Data Analyst and Data Science role as I've pretty good amount of Business, Commerce & Finance, Mathematics knowledge with Keen intrest on Technology and I'm pretty good in IT also with DBMS. 

So, Now I wanted to learn Python then Data Science or Analyst with some ML and AI on hand but luckily Covid 19 hits and all my savings for 6 months is going out slowly. In 2020 I'm going to be a Programmer of python for sure. 

Long para short, It's better to stick to one thing for long, yep sometimes it's hard to figure out which is going to be good but I learner that it's not good to be a perfectionist in each case. If the salary starts at 5L, I'll go for it. Money is not a concern in life. It should be the skills you have in hand and the knowledge & experience you have throughout your journey.

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",1584245186.0,"They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

**Notes**

1) Remember - nothing is free when you are dealing with banks. 

2) Do go through the FAQs and Terms & Conditions of respective banks where you have ongoing EMIs.

3) If you are still confused, always a best choice to talk to the customer support.

4) If you are in good condition to pay the EMIs, pay them. Opting for the moratorium will definitely increase your interest and/or extend EMI duration.",1585834847.0,I have my home loan in ICICI Bank ok and today is my I am day however I can see that it has not been deducted I have also not opted for Moratorium I want to pay my EMI on time and continue doing that what should I do nowBajaj Finserv - [Moratorium FAQ](https://www.bajajfinserv.in/moratorium-details),Business/Finance

1620,Lives & livelihoods in India,7,fzfkko,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/,1,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",1586661910.0,The gov want to restart the economy. I have no issue with that.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",1584858280.0,"None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only.

This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst. Experts say normally it takes a decade to come out of this condition. That's why it is called lost decade.

Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

1626,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,122,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",1573833074.0,"Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to.Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. 

I don't think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school.Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it.",Business/Finance
1627,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",60,ee6xey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,28,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.",1577061630.0,"I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason.This is beautifully written.

1632,GUYS I NEED HELP !!! Debt advice!!,17,dyxvph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyxvph/guys_i_need_help_debt_advice/,26,"I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

4) Financially what I'll be putting myself into by becoming the co applicant.",1574258905.0,"First step before investing in any business, not just your Dads. 

Check the account books, This being India he would be keeping two books. One for official tax and the other to hide it. get access to both. If he does not have these details then please do not even invest a rupee.

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest. 

Third and the most important rule, **NEVER GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS VENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.**This is a risky place to be...

1638,"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now",79,d4mq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,"tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

I'll probably put a tl;dr later.",1568593682.0,"That was a very enlightening read, thank you for the detailed explanations and examples!

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client.I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too.This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

For millennia, the uber rich have controlled the world. With access to better education, networking, medical, climate, resources, and technology, is it even fair for someone from a third world country or other developing nations to dream about achieving the kind of lifestyle that an average first world citizen takes for granted?

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here?

Echo chambers are designed to consolidate like minded people into their own virtual spaces. With confirmation bias playing a significant role in hindering mental evolution, is it really a surprise that people are getting dumber by the day?

1643,Will India embrace blockchain?,3,e8as8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,2,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities.

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

Jagan’s YSR Congress Party has complained to the Election Commission **that the party had fielded at least 35 assembly candidates with names similar to their own candidates.** For example. in Ongole constituency, Jagan’s party has Balineni Srinivas Reddy and Paul’s party has Balineni Srinivasa Rao as their candidate.

> If you think this is not confusing enough, Paul’s election symbol, the helicopter with its rotor blades, when seen in a smaller size could be eerily similar to the fan symbol of Jagan’s party. Add to that the fact that colours of the party flag too are similar.

[Kerala politicians use the fine art of putting dummy candidates to split rival votes](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/kerala-assembly-polls-dummy-candidates-votes-election-commission-2764514.html)

> In the Mathura Lok Sabha constituency in 2014, **BJP candidate Hema Malini had to contend with two other Hema Malinis, who contested as Independents.**

> **But K Sudhakaran of the Congress was not as lucky in Kerala. Having won the Kannur seat in 2009, he lost it in 2014 by 6,566 votes, while two of his namesakes — K Sudhakaran Sreesai and K Sudhakaran Kollod —together polled 7,151 votes.**

> Hunting for people with the same or similar names and enticing them with money into contesting as Independents to split a rival’s votes is a dirty, old trick practised across India.

> Take a look at just one district, Kannur in the north of Kerala:

> - In Irikkur, along with Minister KC Joseph of Congress, there is a Joseph (without initials), an Independent.

> - In Kannur constituency, there are three Satheesans: Satheesan M (Congress), Satheesan P and Satheesan EV (Independents).

> - There are three Shajis in Azhikode: KM Shaji (Muslim League), Shaji KM and KM Shaji (Independents).

> - Thalassery has two Abdullakuttys (one of the Congress and one Independent) and two Sajeevans (Sajeevan VK of BJP and Sajeevan VK, Independent).

> - In Kuthuparamba, CPM’s KK Shailaja has to contend with two other ‘Shylajas’, Independents.

> **Of the Kannur district’s 11 assembly seats, seven have dummies.** In varying degrees, the story is the same in all the 14 districts of Kerala.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

1660,Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,5,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,"By James M. Dorsey

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator. and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me. You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

1668,Broke up 30! What next???,13,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;",1548813778.0,"Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage. * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!

Please help.,5,besg9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/besg9q/is_it_possible_to_switch_careers_at_24_please_help/,3,"I started working in a loose diamonds family business at 22. Worked only for a year and switched to a jewelry factory because it was difficult to work with my dad. 

I am 24 and still at the jewelry factory. The timings are tough - 9 am to 7 pm Mon-Fri. 9 am to 3 pm on Saturdays. I get paid only 55k. But most importantly, this is a dead end job. There is a stagnation in learning and earning after a few years. My manager with an experience of 18 years earns only 130k a month.

I am planning to self-teach web development. I do not come from a technical background. I did my undergrad in BBA in Finance. 

Is it possible to switch careers at this age? Is it possible to get jobs in Singapore, Hong Kong or other countries as a self-taught web developer?

1672,"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]",40,9pj0at,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/,19,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",1539977979.0,"Glad your family situation is better. Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this?

1675,"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",28,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

",1542724145.0,"Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this isHere's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

1676,The Kerala Model,142,79u1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,159,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)



3. Political Violence and the most fertile ground for ISIS recruitment in India. [Kerala tops the crime rate list, with 16.3 riot cases per lakh people, followed by Bihar (12.9) and Karnataka (10.6).](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/327-rise-in-agrarian-riots-in-2015-NCRB-report-shows/article14598321.ece) [How Isis recruiters found fertile ground in Kerala, India's tourist gem.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/isis-recruiters-fertile-ground-kerala-indias-tourist-gem)



4.

[Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)



7. Dire position of the State Finances: [Five charts that explain the crisis in Kerala’s economy.](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/HkujNa0LphyCVSoqFFIEWK/Five-charts-that-explain-the-crisis-in-the-Kerala-economy.html) They even exceeded the Fiscal Deficit Targets which they had committed too.







2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent.

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B;Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.

Benefits:
- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.

> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??

Not sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision.Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place. ",Business/Finance

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",1521841563.0,"I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lolOn a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study. > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

1685,TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,546,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent.

**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

**Even tax officers left foxed by GST form - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A few weeks ago, amid the furore over a massive rise in compliance burden due to GST , the government decided to do a reality check. It set up a few computers and asked several indirect tax officers involved with conceptualisation and implementation of the new regime to try filling up the forms themselves.While there were a few who managed to complete the task, there were several who had difficulty doing what they had been asking businesses to do all over the country. ""Those who were computer-savvy managed to do it but there were some who took time,"" said a source, confirming the development.Suddenly, officers seemed to become aware of complications with the three-stage filing process. ""It seemed there was a sudden change of heart, officers became sympathetic to something they were refusing to acknowledge for months despite complaints,"" said a revenue service officer.The change in mood in the government is apparent with the revenue department and the Central Board of Excise and Customs becoming more responsive to change. But before the officers took the test, the feedback in an internal survey wasn't too favourable either. A survey of businessmen was limited to Gujarat and Haryana and the overwhelming impression was that the process was too cumbersome.Small traders are complaining that GST has resulted in a split between fathers and sons and between brothers — with one of them taking care of the business, while the other handles compliance. The culprit is seen to be requirement to upload elaborate returns every month, then match the invoices uploaded by sellers before the final returns are filed and tax is paid.While the GST Council, comprising state finance ministers and headed by union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, has allowed quarterly filing of returns by businesses with annual turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore, a panel of five state finance ministers has recommended that change should be extended to all companies.Simultaneously, efforts are afoot to improve the functioning of the GST Network, the portal that is used for registration of entities, filing of returns and payment of taxes. Several glitches have been identified and Infosys, the vendor the project, has been asked to tone up, said officials.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",1549016003.0,"Ohh pls...

FORMER FINANCE minister P Chidambaram on Saturday lashed out Modi government, saying demonetisation and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have destroyed the country’s economy, forcing small and medium business to shut down. Interacting with businessmen in Rajkot, the senior Congress leader said demonetisation was not a bold step, but a reckless one. “What’s a bold step? A farmer who commits suicide is also taking a bold step. Do you welcome it? Committing suicide also requires courage. I call it rash, reckless and adventurous step. You call it bold and beautiful. But the point is it has destroyed lives. For nearly two to three months, millions of people stood and waited in queues to exchange their (currency) notes. Nearly,140 people lost their lives. Carpenters, rickshaw pullers, plumbers who depend on daily earning in cash went without business for two months. Demonetisation was a foolish step,” Chidambaram said at an event named Samvad, which was organised by a local Gujarati newspaper.

Chidambaram also took a dig at the government, saying the note ban has failed to achieve all its stated objectives like putting an end to black money, curbing terror funding etc. “There is nothing like black money but merely income which is taxed and income which is taxable but escapes tax net. There is a shadow economy (in India) but there is shadow economy in every other country. India’s shadow economy that is transactions that don’t come under tax net is around 12 per cent. But that’s average for Europe also. There are many European countries which have shadow economy of more than 12 per cent. Even America has around eight per cent shadow economy. What is shadow economy? It is income that your tax system is not able to capture. The answer to shadow economy is to make your tax system more efficient. If you put cruel rates of tax, people will avoid it. People will say why should I pay… If you make friendly tax system, they will pay. The answer is not demonetisation. It’s like saying there is a mosquito in my house, I am going to burn my whole house,” he said.

He added that the introduction of GST in its present form has destroyed small and medium business as requirement for online filing three returns online per month had forced them had forced them to shut down. He said these businesses were job-creators. “If you invest Rs1 crore in big business it won’t create jobs. But small and medium businesses which create jobs are struggling for survival. Therefore, they are not hiring and no jobs are created,” he added.

Chidambaram also claimed that the demonetisation and the roll-out of GST had dealt a severe blow to the economy, sending it into a downward spiral. However, he said, the government maintains that the economy is in fine fettle. “Day before yesterday, the Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) said the Indian economy is on strong micro economic fundamentals. And the finance secretary said it was growing at 7.5 per cent, between 2014 and 2017. Why are they announcing Rs 5 lakh crore Bharatmala? Why are you announcing bank recapitalisation all of a sudden. In your heart, you know things are not good. In the last six quarters, the growth rate has gone down from 9.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. This means a drop of 3.4 per cent,” said the Congress.

The former finance minister opined that it was possible to overcome the situation by “taking right steps and not taking wrong steps”. He said that he has faith that there are people in the country who can take right steps. “The growth rate must not go down below 5.6 per cent. India doesn’t deserve growth rate below 5.7 per cent, and it is possible to take it up by taking right steps and not taking wrong steps. But for that to happen, the government must acknowledge that they committed a mistake by demonetisation and GST. There are people in this country who can do this. Government must hire from outside to correct the mistakes. Those in government can’t do it as they are the ones who have committed the mistakes,” Chidambaram added.

He claimed that 1,326 farmers committed suicide in Gujarat over the last four years. “There are no jobs today. Jobs will be created only if small and medium businesses grow. To help them grow, small businesses should not require to register. Medium businesses must register but they should be given right to self-certification,” said the Congress leader. He said the government was talking about vikas (development). “People talk about growth. Growth is necessary. But what is the use of rojgar-mukta vikas (development sans job creations)” he asked.

The Congress leader also accused the NDA government of misplaced priorities. “They will invest Rs1 lakh crore on bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. How many people will travel in it. Around 300 or 400? Can’t we give Rs1 crore to each school so that new buildings are built, toilets are built, teachers are hired. Our priority is education, health, employment,” he said.

1694,We really need to talk about Flairs.,104,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",1494883276.0,"Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

1696,[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,53,7yvec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/,59,"I received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my SBI account which confused me. Checked my online SBI account and realised that a week back some Google Octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which I had not realised. A simple google search showed that a lot of SBI customers were also complaining about this Google Octro thing (also found a TOI article on it). Its an App on the Google Play store from what I understood. But never mind that, I was just thankful I got my money back. However, a quick advice from my father was to close my SBI account because the Octro company may still have my account details and such, so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again. I've never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because I realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place. So I went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after that.

Now I am not confrontational, and I even see my faults in the whole thing. But the man behind the desk was a whole different story. When I went and old him I'd like to close my account, he looked up the statement of my transactions. And I pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for those.

He used a shitty ass analogy and I quote ""if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesn't realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising."" Yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet. What the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? 

He told me I can't blame the bank for not realising I lost money. Except I didn't even blame the bank. I only told him I wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??

And then I told him I have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so I didn't properly check my account frequently and I realise that its my fault. And then he was like ""of course its your fault. Computer won't make mistakes it'll only do what its told, so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you should've realised and complained."" 

And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

Why are office workers in India so rude? This may seem like a small thing for many of you but I hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. I even admitted the blame on my part and I didn't even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and SBI is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this Google Octro fiasco.

My experience with SBI so far had been pretty decent until this incident. But now I'm just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another bank.

**Deutsche Bank bets on India; zeroes in on bad-loan cleanup to generate outsized returns** 

 ______ 
Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros (.7 billion) of credit risk exposure in
India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. (Reuters)

Deutsche Bank AG, which is in the throes of a global restructuring involving
thousands of job cuts, is zeroing in on an Asian market where an unprecedented
bad-loan clean-up offers the potential for a credit bonanza.

In India, where bankruptcy law changes have injected urgency into efforts to
restructure $210 billion of stressed assets, Deutsche Bank sees an opportunity
to generate outsized returns by refinancing and trading debt, according to
Amit Khattar, Asia-Pacific co-head of global credit trading. Khattar is
considering adding to his team.

“For India, this is where we think the greatest alpha lies for our credit and
financing businesses in the region,” Singapore-based Khattar said in an
interview. “We want to get involved in most of the major deals out there. The
bank has no constraint in terms of scaling up in this area if there’s an
opportunity to grow the business.”

Speculators are flocking to India, lured by what the nation’s richest banker
has called a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to sift through the wreckage of
its bad-loan debacle. Deutsche Bank is already a force there: much of its
Asian credit exposure is in India, and the nation accounts for the second-
biggest share of regional profits.

The bank plans to team up with other firms to arrange financing for Indian
debtors, Khattar said. It’s looking for partners to offer debtor-in-possession
funding — which can keep a business operating during bankruptcy proceedings —
as well as for structuring equity and debt financing for companies before they
slip into difficulty.

Khattar manages more than 100 people in his Asia-Pacific team, which provides
working capital to companies and trades debt on secondary markets. Headcount
has been stable in the past four years, and any addition isn’t expected to be
massive, he added.

He shares the team responsibility with Tokyo-based Beaux Pontak and both of
them report to global head of credit trading Chetankumar Shah in Singapore,
the bank said.

Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is cutting at least 7,000 jobs as new Chief
Executive Officer Christian Sewing seeks to end three straight years of
losses. The firm dismissed four traders in the U.S. who focused on debt
markets, and Chris Lahoud, the head of the distressed team, is leaving, people
with knowledge of the matter said last week. In Asia, it’s trimming some
equity sales and derivatives coverage, Bloomberg reported last month.

**India Exposure**

Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros ($17.7 billion) of credit risk exposure
in India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. That included lending
commitments and traded bonds and debt. By comparison, Japan accounted for 17.3
billion euros while China and Hong Kong made up 16.5 billion euros.

This year alone, Indian lenders are racing to rehabilitate more than 4
trillion rupees ($58 billion) of troubled loans, as the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code in 2016 and banking rules force defaulters to pay up or
restructure. From Canadian pension funds to Asian investment banks, more
capital has flowed into lending, rescue financing and trading of distressed
securities.

Recent debt restructuring cases in India have involved some of the nation’s
biggest companies, including Reliance Communications Ltd., Essar Steel Ltd.
and Bhushan Steel Ltd. Many of the biggest bankruptcy cases are running behind
schedule, however, hit by issues ranging from a shortage of judges to legal
challenges. There are more than 2,500 bankruptcy cases wending their way
through 10 insolvency courts in India’s notoriously slow legal system.

Global private equity firms, special-situation investors, distressed-debt
traders and banks are converging on India, including Apollo Capital Management
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The likes of Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Varde
Partners Inc. are prowling for more.

“The bankruptcy code is a significant development which would generate
considerable opportunities in debt resolution,” Khattar said. “Company owners
also want to retain their business and see long-standing debt issues resolved.
All these need structuring and capital.”

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

You may also like to watch:

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”

“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

1701,India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,9,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.
",1542939833.0,"I didn't read the whole thing cause I'm super sleepy but larger states must be broken, especially UP. It's easier to govern, it's easier to decentralise the power one or a few states hold in national elections, and it gets easier to carry out govt welfare programmes and other schemes, and people can be equally have a larger voice when it comes to holding the system accountable. Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc.Playing the devil’s advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state? I know it seems intuitive, but is that the only factor we should consider? What are the factors that are really holding back growth on our states?

1703,No Progress on the Panama Papers! Despite over 1800 Indian Names Disclosed!,257,63lhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63lhl9/no_progress_on_the_panama_papers_despite_over/,77,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

**‘The party will be over’: How GST will affect businesses that don’t pay tax** 

 ______ 
Rakesh Sachdeva sells auto parts in a busy market in central Delhi, just a few miles from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office. Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.

Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India’s tax officials. Come July 1, however, “the party will be over”, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.

A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country’s biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva’s into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India’s sovereign credit profile.

The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.

Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don’t sign up risk losing any customer who has.

“I have no option, but to register with the new system,” said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.

Boosting the coffers

Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.

India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.

While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.

“In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,” Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. “Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.”

Nair’s company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.

Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.

A REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years.

May: GST Council during its meet in Srinagar fixes rates of goods and services India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth.

Winners and losers

The unorganised sector of India’s economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.

While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms’ accounting systems and an investment in technology.

The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India’s 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.

Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders’ body in Delhi, reckons a “prohibitive” cost could prove to be counterproductive.

“Compliance is needed for input tax credit,” he said. “But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?”

But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.

The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.

Firms can now move to demand-based “hub-and-spoke” models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.

“Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,” said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. “All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.”

Didn't these firms have a sales tax number before?

Companies buying from them earlier would have surely shown whatever they purchased as expenses in their tax filing (I am not talking about tax credit, just expenses in a P & L statement). Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.

**Finance ministry, exporters spar over GST refunds, claims** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The revenue department and the exporters are sparring over unpaid refunds and tax credits that have accrued to businesses since Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented in July.The finance ministry put out a release saying that exporters have claimed integrated GST refunds of Rs 6,500 crore during the first four months of the rollout, while input credit claims added up to Rs 30 crore.But exporters contested the numbers. Citing discussions during an official meeting, exporters claimed that the finance ministry had said that Rs 6,500 crore was around 15% of the overall dues to exporters.""On this basis, the total outstanding refund would be to the tune of Rs 43,000 crore. Central Board of Excise and Customs CBEC ) has no figure of GST refund due to services exports as the same is not routed through customs or where shipping bill is filed. The quarterly exports of services is to the tune of $50 billion,"" said a source.While the tax department advised exporters to file claims in proper form with matching shipping bills to facilitate early settlements, businesses said that problems with the system were making it tough to comply.Many exporters using inland container depots have told the commerce department that their IGST refund claims were not traceable. Since they have received duty drawback, the shipping bills have moved into 'history basket' of the system. As a result, export manifest at the gateway port, which is now being filed, is not getting linked with the shipping bill to facilitate the claim.""This was not told in July. Now, they want us to do all this but even that is not showing. CBEC is in denial mode and that makes it difficult to find an effective solution,"" said an exporter.On its part, the finance ministry said, exporters can upload the final sales return for August in GSTR-1 on GST Network (GSTN) portal from December 4.The CBEC had last month started refunds for exporters of goods who have paid IGST and have claimed refund based on shipping bills. Earlier this month, it allowed businesses making zero-rated supplies or those who have paid IGST on exports or those wanting to claim input credit to fill up a specified form.

BloombergQuint explains it well here:

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill

ELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?

* Do a bail out. 
* Do a bail in. 
* Go bankrupt and close down. 

The point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. 

With great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. 

Now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?

With a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. 

With a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. 

Note: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. 

Now comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. 

So what has changed in this law? Two things:

* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. 
* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. 

What changes for you because of this law:

* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. 

* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. 

Either way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application. Because it is pointless fear mongering.

We had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?

You lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.

The Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.

The matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.

Seriously, what do you think the laws are today?

So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs?",Business/Finance

**Amid Sinha-govt row, India’s flagging economy draws dire warnings of recession** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power on a euphoric wave of promises to boost India’s economy, add millions of jobs and bring “good times” to the developing nation.

Three years later, the country’s economic prospects look decidedly grimmer. India’s economic expansion has slowed to its lowest level in three years. Small businesses are struggling, or even shutting down, after demonetisation and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. Modi’s own allies warn of a dire outlook, with some raising the spectre of an economic depression.

While government ministers have urged patience, analysts and others in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are not so sanguine about the current trends.

“A hard landing appears inevitable,” Yashwant Sinha, a BJP lawmaker and former finance minister, said in a stinging commentary on Wednesday. He accused the government of rushing through poorly planned economic reforms, which he said will hobble home-grown businesses for years to come.

“Private investment has shrunk as never before in two decades, industrial production has all but collapsed, agriculture is in distress, construction industry, a big employer of the work force, is in the doldrums ... exports have dwindled,” he said.

Another leading BJP lawmaker, Subramanian Swamy, said India was facing the possibility of a “major depression.”

“The economy is in a tailspin. Yes, it can crash. We need to do a lot of good things to revive the economy. Even a tailspin can be made to steady. If nothing is done, we are heading for a major depression,” he said last week.

Last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development scaled back its economic growth forecast for India to 6.7% for the 2018 fiscal year, down from 7.3% predicted earlier this year. Other organisations and banks have made similar downward revisions.

Economists have said the country needs to maintain 8% growth to add enough jobs for some 12 million young people joining the work force every year.

The warnings have been sobering for Modi, who appointed a new Economic Advisory Council this week to offer him advice independent of the finance ministry.

Economists said that may be too little, too late.

“The rot has set in. I don’t see how the Economic Advisory Committee will help,” said Biswajeet Dhar, an economist with New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. And “whether the government will act on that advice is yet to be seen”.

India has long been considered a darling market for investors, with high rates of growth and a 1.3 billion population that many companies are eager to reach. Just a year ago, the economy jumped 9.1% in the first quarter — temporarily earning the title of world’s fastest growing economy — and has rarely dipped below 6.5% since 2013.

Still, Modi rose to popularity partly by hammering the previous government over alleged corruption scandals and poor economic performance.

His campaign slogan of “Achhe Din” — Hindi for “Good Times” — helped inspire a mass following across the nation, from university students to business leaders.

And for several months after his election in 2014, things looked good. Foreign investment increased with government moves to open up sectors, imports remained cheap thanks to globally depressed oil prices, and economic growth ticked along at rates above 7%.

By November 2016, the government was confident enough to launch the first of two massive economic reforms.

Without warning, Modi appeared on national television to inform citizens that most of their currency would be worthless in the morning, as the government declared 86% of all rupee notes would be replaced with newly designed bills.

The government said the move was aimed at cracking down on tax evasion, corruption and counterfeiting. But with most of the new bills not yet printed, ATMs ran dry for weeks as account holders stood for days in long lines at banks that gave out only limited withdrawals.

Many small, cash-reliant businesses including grocery stores and home-based workshops suffered huge losses or went under.

Just when things were returning to normal this year, Indian businesses were hit with a second upheaval on July 1 — the replacement of a complex system of cascading federal and state taxes with a single Goods and Services Tax.

The government assured citizens the move would boost economic growth by simplifying the existing tax structure. And again, it was mostly small businesses that suffered the most, with many unable to comply with new, thrice-monthly tax filing requirements.

“A badly conceived and poorly implemented GST has played havoc with businesses and sunk many of them,” said Sinha, the former finance minister.

Rural Indian villages and towns, where more than half of the country’s population relies on farming for their livelihoods, have fared even worse. Demonetization left many farmers, already among the poorest, unable to buy seeds and fertilizer for the sowing season. Their distress was compounded by two years of poor monsoon rains and drought.

Economists are most alarmed, however, by the slowdown in manufacturing and construction — two sectors many had assumed would do well under a business-friendly government. Instead, both have seen a sharp rise in unemployment.

“Major employment creators were the small businesses. They are the ones who have been worst hit,” said economist Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.

Modi is likely to face increasing pressure on the economy as the next general elections in early 2019 approach. “Jobs shortages have the potential of impacting the next elections,” Sharma said.

Still, the government remains upbeat, noting that the latest quarterly growth figure of 5.7% was still pretty good compared with how other nations were faring.

“The government has taken some very important decisions,” said Cabinet minister Piyush Goyal, who long held the energy portfolio but now heads the railways ministry. “Difficulties and criticism will come. But we are confident, and we will stay the course.”

With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) – AU Financiers – before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here’s what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company’s business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB’s gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management’s successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB’s profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. “Despite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,” it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. “We expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB’s market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. “We believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,” the brokerage said.

1714,Indian banking system under attack!,171,589exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/589exo/indian_banking_system_under_attack/,84,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

**RBI revises definition of what constitutes a bank branch** 

 ______ 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), apart from reworking the definition of a bank branch, also widened the role of bank boards, making them responsible for complying with the new guidelines. Photo: Mint

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.

According to the revised policy, RBI has defined “a banking outlet” for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank’s staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week”. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called “part-time banking outlet.”

While the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI’s permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a “rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‘banking outlet’ of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions”.

With the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‘banking outlets’ or ‘part-time banking outlets’. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of “banking outlets”. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a “branch” which also included off-site ATMs.

The proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. “With a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,” RBI had said in the policy statement.

Later an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.

The revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as “banking outlets” though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. “Nevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,” RBI said.

“This policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,” said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.

At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. 

You could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.

The thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

#What can we do about it now?

Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

1718,Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,422,47ogw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/,93,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.

Indian Express reported the NPA problem first on [February 9, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/).

EDIT 2: Gold! Thank you kind stranger. ",1456511511.0,"awesome writeup! thank you for taking the time to make the jargon clear to us!While bad on paper - the current scenario is actually better than expected.

The fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life - these loans extend to many many places, from large firms to small farmers.

It was always expected that some government, would have to intervene ecentually to fix this. It's the NDA who has to handle it, and I fully expect them to handle it. The issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers, with the GoI firmly in the driving seat.

But the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse. It's a mainstay of Indian politics, in one form or the other. One of the ""unspoken rules"" of the game so far.

The divestiture of PSUs, or stronger oversight/capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help. 

The clean up of banks will be a good thing, and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector, which can handle any future negative shock.

Honestly, this is business as expected. It's good that people are upset, but being upset won't make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking/private network.

Rules which are followed, divestment, distance between center/politics and PSU management are the cure - and they've been the cure since the reform process started, but haven't been completed.

**Regulatory reform fails to cut red tape: NITI Aayog** 

 ______ 
The survey conducted by NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country. Graphic: Mint

New Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.

The nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.

Not only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.

The results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.

To be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.

While 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.

The World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. “The experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,” it said.

India’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.

The NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.

On average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. “Therefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,” the survey recommended.

Conceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that “every single company needs to be told about the changes taking place”.

Based on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.

Some analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. “The robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.

FDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government’s full attention.

1722,Last Week in the Indian Parliament #2 (May 02 to May 06),366,4it1ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4it1ef/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_2_may_02_to/,68,"Hello /r/India!

I bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. 

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

___
#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

___
#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

___
#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating.

#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

###Headline Stories

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry has long been dominated by men, a trait it shares with many of its counterparts abroad. But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.
 
 They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies — who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.
 
 Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals
 Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year
 Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon 
 
 In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US — for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.
 
 The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. ""I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,"" says Thapar.
 
 Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. ""These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,"" says Thapar.
 
 At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. ""I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,"" she adds.
 
 Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.
 
 She has launched a program called ""Prerna"" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.

1728,Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,32,65nu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/,47,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",1492352581.0,"Stay in nederdraad. Visit once twice a year. You won't regret long term. It's at such times only that you have to decide your priorities in life, and develop and follow your principles. I personally believe in this - ""The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships"". A poor person can be quite happy if surrounded by people he loves. A very rich man will not be happy without loved ones.

That said, things are more complicated. Employment and infrastructure is bad in India. And it's not always that our family or relationships will be good. So you have to decide whether things are worth it.

One idea probably is to work in your prime years abroad, earn a shitload of money, marry a desi import or someone okay with moving to India, save your money, and return to India in time for your kids to go to college. And retire here. All the while visiting as much as you can, to keep in touch with family and also making arrangements for your future.

Or another one is to take the leap of faith, return to your motherland, try and work to do your bit to improve this country, and save your wife and kids the trauma of moving.

Staying there, you will always remain an outsider. And so will your kids, be them desi or mixed race. I wouldn't want that for my children. Family sticks when no one will. Your 'friends' and 'neighbours' won't take care of you when you're​ sick or grow old.",Business/Finance

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

1730,What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,38,6f3v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/,29,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",1496556903.0,"You do know that Bitcoin cannot be regulated and a ban would only hamper the perceived sovereignty of INR. No problem with bitcoin gaining popularity, but the reading the replies of OP here, it seems he created this post to shove his point of view up others asses rather than to listen to their point of views.Ok, I'll bite. 

> Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming.

Sure they have. But is it illegal in India or USA ? If tomorrow Amazon decides that it will accept payments in Gold , Bitcoins or any legal doohickeys , can they prosecute Amazon ? This is NOT a rhetorical question so please feel free to answer.


Plus why would I buy anything using a bitcoin today if as you say yourself "" ...will make you rich over time if you just put a $100 in there today"" ? 

Some people were not fortunate as you are today. They knew that in a year their Tulip could have fetched more than an entire country , but unfortunately they could not preserve it. We don't have that problems with BTC. So lets never use them till each BTC is worth a gazillion kabillion dollars.

> ...middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" ...

How in the fricking hell do you think an average Amit in India or an average Joe in Europe will be buying a BTC ? Do you fucking suppose that they will mine the BTC ? Have you ever heard of coindesk ? Exchanges ? Tumblers ? Are these being run as cooperatives ? Is Satoshi running these ?

> Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them

I suppose Paypal , and the newly introduced Google Wallets , Amazon pay , Samsung Pay, Apple Pay , Isis wallet are just barely hanging in there with NOBODY using them. Starbucks processing more than 8 million transactions each week on its own wallet is just an alternate fact , ain't it ! 

> PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm

Are there businesses which are NOT supposed to support the CEO and its shareholders to become a billionaire ?

If you feel that Paytm suffers from lack of basic communication , well , no one is forcing you to use it.

1731,"Digital finance to add $700 billion to India’s GDP, create 21 million jobs by 2025: McKinsey",36,543c2b,http://www.livemint.com/Industry/yLr2Zazfkv10JWTKC6ID7J/Digital-finance-to-add-700-billion-to-Indias-GDP-create-2.html,2,,1474638694.0,"21 million jobs by 2025? That sounds pretty optimistic to put it mildly.

I think the greatest effects of the digital drive in general is to reduce leakages in the system, especially with regards to subsidies. We've already seen reports saying that state governments have found savings of 20-30% of total cost in many cases. In some programs, oversubscribtion by over 50% of the actual number of people who need the subsidies have been found and rooted out.

This level of financial efficiency will improve the deficit and give more fiscal space for the government to invest in pro-growth reforms, which should help GDP growth. But these fantastical jobs numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. India often suffers from the dual syndrome of undue pessimism only to be transformed into unrealistic hype, which then turns into depression and so the cycle goes. It's better to anchor people with a more grounded worldview which is optimistic but realistic about the speed of which it can be done.Nearly two-thirds of India’s GDP increase will come from improved productivity of businesses and governments as a result of digital payments, said a McKinsey report

New Delhi: Businesses will soon be able to know which company they should not deal with if tax hassles are to be avoided.

Federal indirect tax body, the goods and services tax (GST) Council is planning to implement from January a ranking of businesses based on their track record of tax payments. This ranking will enable businesses to judge how likely a material or service supplier will default on its tax payment obligations which could result in blockage of tax rebates if these items are sourced from them, an official who attends Council meetings said on condition of anonymity.

The ranking system is being worked out as a solution to complaints from companies that the tax rebates due to them are getting blocked for no fault of theirs because their suppliers who charged tax-inclusive prices have not remitted taxes to the government.

Although tax authorities recognize that it is unfair to deny rebate to a company which has already paid indirect tax to its vendor, they are unable to grant the benefit as it will hurt the exchequer.

Firstly, the tax that ought to have come in from one of the parties to a transaction hasn’t been received and secondly, the other party may claim refund from the government of what has been paid to its vendor. In the previous tax regime, there had also been many instances of fraud where fake invoices from vendors have been used to claim refund.

The Council believes the best way is to encourage businesses to avoid dealing with crooks.

Experts said the ranking system may have a flip side or two. While it will facilitate a company to know the compliance level of its vendors, it is possible that businesses that have not paid certain taxes due to genuine alternative interpretation of law may get a poor score.

“It is unfair to place the responsibility of good behaviour of the supplier on the buyer, who unlike the government, has no enforcement powers other than approaching a court of law,” said R. Muralidharan, senior director, Deloitte India. The ranking system should only capture defaults in payment of taxes that is collected from customers, he said.

The GST compliance rating system, for which an enabling provision has been made in section 149 of the Central GST Act was not implemented at the time of launching the new tax system from 1 July as the cycle of tax return filing is yet to get stabilized.

“Only when the cycle of return filing settles down over the next few months, the authorities will get to know the level of compliance of assesses,” said Bipin Sapra, tax partner at the consulting firm EY.

1734,"[NP] Businesspeople of r/india, need your advise.",11,3okalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3okalt/np_businesspeople_of_rindia_need_your_advise/,10,"Hi good people of r/india. I'm 31 and in a pretty heavy mess. I started a logistics b2b business in late 2012 after being in a first generation family run business (logistics too) since 2007. The industry has cut-throat competition and is also very unorganised and unregulated (anyone with a PAN card and an address can start) ; which is also probably the reason I could start mine (I barely had any other licenses, market knowledge or professional business management experience). I had some working capital to begin with (~Rs. 20L) and I burnt through the cash within a few months while trying to fiercely enter the market by selling below or at cost. Other than underquoting, selling at cost or absorbing the operational losses to safeguard the customer, I really didn't use the money at hand for any meaningful long term capital expenditure like systems, inventories, warehouses, staff etc. So once I ran out of cash (and this happened in mid-2013) I had absolutely no leverage to retain the hard-earned (and costly) customers and I started losing them. So though there was some decent turnover through all that cash burn, the bottom lines were all naturally red.

All this put me under tremendous stress. Under stress instead of approaching the banks for fresh funds, I approached private lenders for instant small funds to clear off the immediate debts to the vendors. These borrowings were obviously super costly but I ignored them so as not to antagonise the vendors. But the private lenders had a very small kitty compared to my requirements and suddenly I was left having to pay off the lenders as well as the vendors! 

In between all this, although I had asked my family to give me some time to settle down and tried making them understand the mess I was in, they barely understood anything and pressurised me into getting married. It was an arranged marriage. I do not want to blame my family anymore than this about the marriage because I am blessed with a very supportive and understanding wife. So I married in mid 2014. That happened and within 8-9 months, we decided (yet again against my full approval) to buy a freaking house. On one hand my business was bleeding cash so much that there was no blood left to even bleed and on the other I was shopping for houses - because my family (this time my wife and in-laws included!) absolutely wanted us to own a house of our own. Won't blame my wife because it was barely an year into the marriage and I hadn't told her the full extent of the issues as I didn't want to scare or stress her, so she and my in-laws were obviously not fully aware of the facts. 

Now, most of my family (excluding the wife and in-laws, once they realised they may have pressurised into buying the house they do not want to put any more undue pressure) are telling me to find a job to relieve part of the stress and I am willing too to look for a job. But I'm neck deep in liabilities and I just don't know how I can simply shut shop one day and just go looking for a job without fulfilling all my current liabilities.

All this might sound like a template for the perfect financial & business mismanagement, but here I am stressed as stressed can be and I really could use some advise. ",1444754634.0,"OP, if you do not have loan/mortgage on your house, take a loan on that and pay off your other liabilities. House loan is by far the cheapest source of capital in India. That would give you breathing time.

But if you do have housing loan and are not in a position to borrow more on that, then you need to consider selling it and moving into a rental house for some years. ",Business/Finance

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

1736,[NP] Where would you recommend travelling in India as a solo woman?,17,7uer5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7uer5b/np_where_would_you_recommend_travelling_in_india/,16,"Edit: Thank you so much to everyone for all of the insight and advice, especially the women who took the time to speak to their experiences!! Busy researching and taking all of your responses into account. A million thanks! <3

Hey, lovely people of Reddit!

Travelling India has been one of my lifelong dreams, and I finally find myself in a place where I'm able to begin saving up to make that dream a reality! I now come before you beautiful folk to seek advice in forming an itinerary.

Some details:

-I'm looking to stay anywhere from 3 months to a year, depending on finances. 

-I hope to find ways to meaningfully immerse in each place I visit (through volunteer positions, homestays, etc) and am definitely not looking to rush from one city to the next.

-I am especially interested in rural, natural areas which provide possibilities for trekking and other outdoor adventures. I am not at all interested in touristy, expat party bubbles.

-I'm excited by food (who isn't?), literature, history, music, yoga and Ayurvedic health practices.

I know these are fairly vague constraints but I'm overwhelmed by the vastness of the country and its multiplicities and would very much appreciate any pointers as to where to begin my travel research!

I plan on doing most of my exploring as a solo female traveler, so would also appreciate any advice to that end. 

A million thanks in advance!!
",1517474036.0,"I have been traveling for the last 6 months myself, and have seldom come across a female traveler that had problems. You would need to be careful though. People are friendly, but you would find creeps as well just like you would find anywhere else.

I think the most important thing for a female traveler is to choose hotels wisely. I would suggest booking zostels(a chain of backpacker hostels) wherever possible. Other than that you can book via booking.com (Reviews are really well written and thus I have rarely been surprised). Once you are in a decent hotel, the host can be of great help as he would be able to guide you with do’s and dont’s of that place. (India is a vast country, with varied culture, locals are the best people to ask for advise)

Apart from that you should maybe divide India into 4 zones and proceed one by one. In my opinion all of them have a different flavour:

* North (Himalayas) would be awesome for trekking

* west and center (Rajasthan and nearby) would be awesome if  you are inclined towards architecture

* south (Kerala and nearby) would be awesome for vipasana, yoga, beaches and forest covers

* east (Assam and nearby) would be awesome if you want to see tribal culture since it’s the most untouched part of India.

I am traveling in the north east for the next two months. Feel free to PM if you plan to be there as well. Maybe we can meetup.

You can also PM me if you want to know more about any place. I am running a traveler community startup and thus would be able to connect you with some user who is a resident of where you want to go.

Stay safe, and happy journey!Come to Karnataka, you can have a base in Mysore. Clean city and friendly People. Travel to Coorg or Chikmagalur for nature, Adventure and food.
Yoga schools and Ayurvedic practitioners are in plenty in Mysore. Visit Hassan and surroundings for the amazing Holsala temples.

I will be done in December. I haven’t done 10+2 –> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters.

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions.

Labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya.

The Modi government is fast-tracking the legislative part of labour reforms, long held up due to political reasons. Even though it hasn’t yet got the Opposition to agree to the agenda, at least one of the two important Bills in this regard will be pressed in the ongoing Budget session. If things go as per the Centre’s plan, establishments employing up to 300 will soon have the right to lay off workers without government approval and outsiders — read professional politicians — will be barred from leading trade unions in the organised sector. Currently, only smaller units employing up to 100 people can lay off workers sans government nod.

Labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya told FE: “We are going ahead… The drafts of both the wage code and the industrial relations (IR) code have been prepared. Presentations to different ministries have been made and a tripartite committee meeting has been held. In the second leg of the Budget session, we will definitely introduce the wage code. Although we are simultaneously working on the IR code, it may come up only in the next session.”

Also Watch:



The proposed reforms are, however, not just industry-friendly — they also tend to make the workers’ rights more robust. For instance, the wage code will make national minimum wage mandatory for all establishments. Currently, the wage thresholds prescribed by the Centre are not followed by all states. In the proposed regime, while the states will have the power to fix the minimum wages, these can’t be below the national threshold. All four wage-related central Acts — the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 — will be amalgamated under the proposed comprehensive wage code. The IR code also proposes to bar strikes without 14 days’ notice.

However, an inter-ministerial meeting convened on Tuesday to take a call on introducing the codes in Parliament was postponed due to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s busy schedule. Dattatreya said that the meeting would take place in a day or two. A fresh momentum has been imparted to passage of the codes after the go-ahead from the finance minister, a source said.

The Modi government feels that labour reforms at the national and state levels are integral to improving India’s unimpressive ease of doing business rank and accomplishing the objective of making India a global manufacturing hub.

Any income of a political party which is chargeable under the head ""Income from house property"" or ""Income from other sources"" or ""Capital gains"" or any income by way of voluntary contributions received by a political party from any person shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of such political party :

Provided that—

(a) such political party keeps and maintains such books of account and other documents as would enable the Assessing Officer to properly deduce its income therefrom;

(b) in respect of each such voluntary contribution 12[other than contribution by way of electoral bond] in excess of twenty thousand rupees, such political party keeps and maintains a record of such contribution and the name and address of the person who has made such contribution; 13[and]

(c) the accounts of such political party are audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288 14[; and] :

(d)  no donation exceeding two thousand rupees is received by such political party otherwise than by an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or an account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account or through electoral bond.


To explain it out for you, it basically states that any income except the one chargeable from business or profession is exempt from tax provided that the party abides by certain conditions.

1743,Why are Indian entrance exams so different from globally accepted exams such as GMAT and SAT?,24,70fyiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/70fyiq/why_are_indian_entrance_exams_so_different_from/,13,"[Articles such as this one](http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/do-engineers-have-an-advantage-in-cat-here-s-busting-all-myths/story-xJtJ7YMldPiDokQlU6bk7M.html) blatantly dismiss CAT's bias towards engineers as a myth. I'm fairly certain that the level of mathematics is that of 6th - 10th grades.


[This article](http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1952) seems to make more sense.


Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.


Also, people generally say that the verbal sections are tougher in GMAT, then why is it that CAT is more anal retentive and fanatical about vocabulary?",1505582001.0,"CAT, SAT, GMAT all have upto 10 std level math. No difference there.GMAT allows calculators, for CAT you need to manually calculate, learn shortcuts, etc. English in GMAT is more practical and centers around application; CAT is more about vocabulary and memorizing word meanings.

I initially befriended her, then did some business with her, and eventually convinced her into agreeing to live with me.

Then for 200 days, I raped her. I brainwashed her, I taught her what to think, and I raped her some more.

But I also fed her, took care of her medical expenses, and introduced her to Netflix - something she'd have never experienced the joy of if she wasn't my captive. 

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in.

1745,5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard ?,28,6cfxc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6cfxc8/5_reasons_why_layoff_in_india_can_be_especially/,21,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

*IT employees kindly don't contactMost of these are related to, ""oh, what will the society think of me"". While I get the importance of fitting into society, and not being an outcast, our incessant desire to be ""approved"" by people is doing us more harm than good. How can a person, going through such a tough time, see an sliver of hope, when their mind is clouded worrying about their perception by others?

Ours is a shallow, judgmental society. They'll celebrate you when you have succeeded according to their standards, but also denigrate and vilify you, when you go through a tough time, like a layoff, or fail an exam. That is a really toxic attitude. It makes a bad situation worse. The person cannot see a setback as an opportunity to become better or take a break to clear their mind, but as a final word on their identity and fate.

It's borderline psychotic what our society considers acceptable behaviour to a person going through a difficult time.All sound like probable valid reasons, but are signs of an unhealthy society. I was about to write a long write up going into detail here, but I lost interest.  ",Business/Finance

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

___

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

I leave you with an interesting comment made by Kalikesh Singh Deo during the Uttarakhand debate:

#Rajya Sabha Association prijhents “Bye Bye Honourable Members Mohatsav”
___

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)
___
**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

1748,"I feel I am being economically forced to choose a career (MBA) that I don't necessarily want(?), while my true passion lies somewhere else.",11,85cyx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/85cyx9/i_feel_i_am_being_economically_forced_to_choose_a/,9,"TDLR: I got a offer letter from a good MBA university in India, but I don't feel my passion truly lies in MBA, rather it lies in bio-sciences. However, career in pure sciences isn't exactly promising and stable, definitely not in India, but maybe abroad.

Last year I completed my BSc from Mumbai University with fairly nice grades and I am currently at the end of 1st year of my MSc. I hate it here. I don't feel like I am learning anything new at all. It's repetition of what we did in BSc. I want to leave this MSc to go for a MS in Germany (Not any other country because I can only afford the tuition fee subsidised German education, not even the elite science institutes in India because lack of a MS in bio engineering, the pathetic state of research in India even in the elite instis, the horrible scientific culture of India, in short I don't want to study science in India.) in TU Dresden or Munich or Max planck or similar. I have friends there who are just on my head to give IELTS and apply for my dream MS institute. My dad now feebly supports this plan too so no family problem.

There are some major caveats to this career line. Firstly it is too hyper specialised and in it's infancy. Very few businesses are offering jobs to bio engineers. So my best option is to stay there in Germany and do a PhD. Not that it is a terrible option but again the question of 'then what' arises. This is more of less the same situation in every pure science field with a lot of unknowns and variables. What I desperately want to avoid is being in a situation where I am not getting opportunities in Germany and I have to come back home with a degree that isn't worth anything in India. 

This is one option that I have currently which isn't promising, I haven't even applied to these institutes yet. Too much uncertainty with respect to career, financing and opportunities. But it has my passion. And passion isn't something I say lightly. I am so interested in fields biology that I have that I have spent hours and hours of reading one Wikipedia article after another like a crack addict drugging himself to keep his high. Here I am referring just one page of an interesting topic and boom 8 hours later, I have 50 tabs open on my browser and I am reading a research paper on tissue engineering and its future applications. One could say I am passionate about biology. 

The problem is, I also like making money. I will just say it flatly. I am just as passionate of making money as I am passionate of biology. And it is difficult to have a comfortable career in Biology AND owning that house I dream of or buying that latest PC rig or god forbid, a good retirement plan. I have seen what lack of money did to my family and I never want to be in a position where I have to borrow money from someone or rent some shitty apartment. I want to provide for my future wife and children.(I know this prospect is little premature for that but still.)

Hence I went into the MBA rat race, joined classes, studied, and after a hellish year of self loathing and realising how pathetic I am in maths, I have an offer letter from one of the top ten B-schools of India. It isn't some MBA finance or some god level MBA, I just don't have the calibre for it and I didn't score high enough on the tests for fiance, but it is MBA in pharmaceuticals. The course is amazing. A lot of learning opportunities, 100% placement, average package 8 lakhs, lowest 6, highest 14, lot of field experience and 2 or 3 seniors last year bagged international placements in pharma MNCs. Kewl.

Everyone around me is elated and happy and congratulating me and I am here sitting just confused more than ever. It is indeed a big break for me, I have been depressed and miserable for 2 years, tensed about what I will do in life. So a part of me ( and my dad ) feel I should just accept what is on my plate right now and not demand for something better. 

The truth is, my MBA entrance exam attempts this year wasn't even 60% of my total potential. And I feel I could do a lot better and get that prestigious MBA Finance from NMIMS, JB, XLRI, or some mid tier IIMs. IIM ABC ka aukaad nai hai mera so I am not even thinking of those. My CMAT score was 96 percentile. What if I score better next year? If I choose MBA pharma this year, there's no turning back, I will be propelled in the pharma industry. I don't know how to sell drugs.

I feel I am being economically forced to choose MBA, but I am not exactly complaining because MBA has money, science doesn't, while science has my passion, but no money. I know I am making a blanket statement here but certainly there are exceptions, but you get my general idea right. I know that I should have made this decision long ago, but I didn't feel like I will get into any good B school.

One small possibility I see is, doing an MBA in pharma and working in a biomedical devices company which is something close to my passion. 

MBAs of reddit, scientists of reddit in india and overseas, and anyone who might have some suggestions, what should I do? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option? What would you do? I have to confirm my MBA admission in 10 days. I have only 10 days to decide how I am going to lead the rest of my life. I would seriously appreciate some counsel.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them.

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

Mumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.

This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.

The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.

Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.

Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.

The company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Shah.

Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.

“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,” said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.

The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, “and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” he said.

In an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.

1755,Hello /r/india I have an MBA financing related question to ask you,39,5ycazs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ycazs/hello_rindia_i_have_an_mba_financing_related/,21,"I got into Oxford's Said Business School for their MBA program, which costs a lot of money. I have been working for the last 4 years and have saved up 12 lakhs, which covers my cost of living. The tuition is insane (40 lakhs). I've contacted Prodigy finance, that disburses loans to MBA students. ATK where I work refused to sponsor my tuition.  
My father informed me that he may support my living expenses, but he does not want to finance my tuition since he wants to use the money towards his own business.  
I want to know how I'm supposed to secure funding. Dont want to bank on the academic excellence scholarships at Oxford.  
Do Indian banks give money to MBA students going abroad? Which banks do? What if I have no collateral?  
 
Profile: I scored 800 in GMAT and have 87% from Mumbai University Bcom from Jai Hind. Ive worked in ATK for the last 4 years. 
  
",1489053608.0,"800 GMAT and only 1 admit, and no scholarship? 

Where else did you apply? 

Look here as well: https://www.gyandhan.com/800 in the GMAT? Damn that's amazing. I'd wait to hear what sort of scholarship you get before deciding on a funding option. Check if Saïd has a need-based scholarship option, but honestly you should get something for academic excellence. Once you have that information, then you'll know how much you need. If you have 12 and your dad is offering 10, then you need about 30L more to finance your MBA (assuming 0 scholarship). 

Private banks have mostly stopped giving education loans. One exception is HDFC, which finances education through a company called Credila. However, for any non-US MBA courses, they will require collateral/security. State banks disburse educational loans, but they have a soft limit of 20 lakhs, but this can be increased based on requirement. Once you have a final number you'd need to borrow, build a relationship with someone from State Bank of India and walk them through your requirement. In cases where credit history is good and risk is low, they can disburse loans without collateral. 

Prodigy is also an option, but they take a few months to verify your credit score here in India and disburse the loan. On the plus side... No payments until after the course and no collateral. 

All the best! >Do Indian banks give money to MBA students going abroad 

You will get the loan but its a lot of jhanjat and paper work. Start ASAP. 

Max loan for foreign education is 25 L? When I went it was 20 L so looked pointless. 

The collaterals will be your fathers. 

All banks do. Public banks be better.",Business/Finance

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

* Chalk this one up to the Romeo and Juliet category of mergers - the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, Mr. Lohani has [blamed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/air-india-merger-led-to-a-mess-ashwani-lohani/article8621785.ece) the distraught airline’s debt and losses on the 2011 merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. Mr. Lohani, who took over the basket case of an airliner just last year, seems to have lost all hope as he stated that Air India has a bureaucracy bigger than even the Indian Railways, the mother-load of all bureaucracies.

* After the rise of Flipkart and the likes, everyone and their mother is getting in on the ecommerce game. The Tatas are now [launching](https://inc42.com/flash-feed/tata-group-enter-ecommerce-space-launch-cliq/) CliQ, an online retailer selling apparel, electronics, footwear and more from over 80 brands. This comes right after Arvind Ltd. (the Indian partner of brands like Arrow, Lee, Wrangler etc.) launched its ecommerce play, NNNow.com (I didn’t have a seizure, that’s the actual name). This also comes months after the Reliance Group launched ajio.com and the Aditya Birla Group launched abof.com.

* Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka is making some serious coin - Sikka, who has boosted all the numbers that matter since taking over in 2014, will be [paid](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/vishal-sikka-kicks-in-big-salary-spikes-at-infosys/articleshow/52287712.cms) ₹74 crore including stock options this year, which works out to 116 times the median salary of Infosys employees. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

Previous week's thread : [Indian Startups Last Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/513183/indian_startups_this_week/)",1473600488.0,"Thanks man. Really amazing what you're doing.is it really that easy to raise funds ? I have really great ideas. 

How do i start? ",Business/Finance
1758,I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,8,7jrv4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrv4g/i_am_forwarding_an_interesting_story_about_world/,8,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!
The world is in a economical mess 😅- interesting read",1513290195.0,"But when Americans spend money in America, the money stays in America. But if you will spend money in India, most of this money will go out of India.
Example: Buy a IPhone product in America and India. I get a feel this is snake oil logic. 

People need money to spend. Here currency is inr, so exporters would get paid in inr, and hence the Q may be to ask why is dollar so much more valuable and also why do Americans have so much more of it ? 

I have personally thought over what creates value at the very core and the answer always seems to me to be creation of new intellectual property in which US is the leader and will be for more time to come. 

As to why Americans have so much of it? I think it might be a very complicated Q and part of answer might be that they print it and also that lot of countries want to save in dollars and also invest in infrastructure creation in America...

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

**No Smoking**

A group of cigarette manufacturing companies led by ITC Ltd. ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation. Photo: Mint

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.

Modi’s government already had its work cut out to finalise a deal with India’s 29 federal states to launch a goods and services tax (GST) on 1 April that would transform Asia’s third-largest economy into a single market for the first time.

But his decision to scrap 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge the economy of “black money”, has caused huge disruption.

A slump in business activity stemming from the cash crunch has caused the revenue of state governments, which collect value-added tax on goods and other duties, to slump by 25-40%.

The states won’t risk another setback by rushing the sales tax into force.

“The investment and economic environment in the country is in bad shape,” said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who earlier head a panel tasked with building a consensus on the GST. “How is the country going to absorb the dual shock of GST and demonetisation?”

The GST is India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It would replace a plethora of federal and state levies with one tax, easing compliance, broadening the revenue base and boosting productivity.

It took Modi more than two years to forge a political compromise on the tax in August. Now, demonetisation “has created a trust deficit,” said Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac. “After this, I am not going to sit and compromise. They don’t deserve it.”

Left in the lurch

Failure to break the deadlock could tip India into a fiscal crisis: The GST would need to come into effect by mid-September, when the old system of indirect taxation is due to lapse. The lingering uncertainty is worrying companies needing to understand financial implications of the new tax.

“With so many vital details still missing, they are feeling left in the lurch,” said Saloni Roy, a senior director at Deloitte.

Modi’s shock move last month to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes was aimed at India’s shadow economy. But the ensuing cash crunch has caused job losses, disrupted supply chains and slowed construction activity.

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.

Ambit Capital, a Mumbai brokerage, forecasts growth this fiscal year will be only half of the roughly 7% level many expect. The Reserve Bank of India has shaved its growth outlook by half a percentage point to 7.1%.

To make up for their losses, states are seeking compensation and will press their case at a meeting in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday with finance minister Arun Jaitley.

He has already agreed to cover states’ revenue losses for five years after the GST’s launch, but further concessions would narrow his room for manoeuvre in his annual budget presented in February.

One top finance ministry official dismissed demands for compensation for demonetisation as unreasonable. But states are adamant. “They have brought it upon us,” V. Narayanasamy, chief minister of Puducherry, told Reuters. “Now they must pay for our loss.”

Counting costs

The quibble is not just over lost revenue. Some states worry about the social and political costs of demonetisation.

Take Kerala, where credit cooperatives that farmers and retired government workers rely on cannot swap old bills or issue fresh notes. The state alleges this has encouraged commercial banks to scout for their deposits, sparking a “run” on them.

Odisha’s chief minister has written to Modi, saying curbs imposed on primary agriculture societies were making it difficult for farmers to access crop loans and procurement payments.

With the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.

They want sole control over businesses with annual turnover of Rs15 million ($220,000) and so-called “dual control” over bigger firms. Jaitley opposes this, fearing tax collectors could end up at cross purposes.

“We reached this far because states were willing to compromise,” said Isaac, Kerala’s finance minister, told Reuters. “If they want the GST, they will have to now concede to the states.” Reuters

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation.

I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

* If you’ve been reading this series regularly, you’ve likely realized two things by now - One, there is still faith for humanity and two, there is none for the banks. Canara Bank [reported](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/wWFiLKBr59fsto0fcqlbpO/Canara-Bank-posts-Rs-3905-crore-loss-in-Q4.html) a loss of ₹3,905 crore for January-March quarter. When the davids fall like dominos, the goliaths have to be limping, at the very least. The State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country, [limped](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-q4-fy-201516-results/article8654996.ece) along with a 66% fall in net profit to ₹1,263 crore. But the bad news at SBI wasn’t as bad as everyone expected, and so shares of SBI are up 17% despite a fall in profits. Yeah. That happens. Welcome to Dalal Street.

* For years now, kulcha warriors across the nation have been screaming that all things western are literally cancer. Well, they might not be entirely wrong. After demolishing Nestle by finding lead in Maggi, the powers that be have wished the end of Domino’s Pizza, McDonald’s and Subway as well. A study by the Center for Science and Environment [found](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/india-domino-s-mcdonald-s-operators-hurt-by-bread-cancer-report) that the bread used by these companies includes a cancer-causing substance. Shares of Jubilant Foodworks (Indian partner of Domino’s) and Westlife Development (franchisee of McDonald’s) were down on the news.

* As a net importer of oil, India has raked in millions as oil prices nosedived from a high of $100 to a low of $30. But every coin has two sides - and sadly, this isn’t that double-headed coin Jai used in Sholay. In real life, the good comes with the bad. Some 7 million Indians work abroad in the oil-rich Gulf countries that have fallen on bad times, and more and more are being forced to come home. Remittances from Indians working abroad [slumped](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-remittances-idINKCN0YG2OE) 27% to $48 billion - lowest since the 2008 crisis.

* The markets have a reputation for being sensitive. They tend to react even if Raghuram Rajan so much as sneezes. So events like the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate hike, or Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union, or China’s worsening economy are all but guaranteed to sway the markets one way or another. But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

So I'm 22. Just out of college having studied finance and business, I feel I am ready to start with a small amount, I have a little over a Lakh saved for stocks. My questions are, what is the best method to invest in them personally? ie I want to manage it myself, not a broker or anything. Secondly, I am aware of the Valuation methods such as DDM and Cash FLow Valuation. I can even do a thorough financial Analysis of the company's accounts having a finance background. My dad said a lot of that wont be useful in India as there is a lot of dirty business going on and not a lot of it is done on merit. Guys that have been doing it for a while, it would be great if you could share your stories and help a young guy out.",1459869271.0,"Hey dude, I started investing in Jan. I am sharing what I learned in the last few months.

* Read ""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch. It will give you a new perspective to look at companies.
* You should start with Nifty 50 companies. Those companies will not die and will force you into a habit to checking financial news and the stocks prices in general.
* Create a portfolio on google finance or moneycontrol of companies you think you will be interested in.
* Read news related to your portfolio companies.
* Use screener.in for stock screening.
* Its better to buy when the stock market is down. Jan-Feb was the perfect time to join for me since every stock was down. So I invested in some blue chip companies all of which are giving me > 10% return. 
* Since the market is still fluctuating look for days when it has gone down to pick up stocks.
* Start slow with 15-20k and look at how things work out.
* Don't pick expensive shares which cost more than 1000 or ones with PE ratio more then 20. Since if you will be able to buy on 10-15 shares so even if the prices go up by 100 the net income will be only 1000 (you will pay brokerage also on this).  Also price change of 100 does not happen so quickly.

The best way to learn is to start investing. Do not be afraid of failures. Take calculated risks on how much you can afford to lose. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT invest in individual stocks after analyzing their cash flow you read through their annual reports. 

1- That information is already priced-in. People have priced the stock based on that information. 

2- There are people with better information then you, those who know CFO ( insider trades) , have been given a tour of the factory( analysts) or understand the sector far better than you. Also there are billion dollar companies who have far more advanced models than what your quad core laptop can possibly run. 

In short, you will not be a player with any advantage by analyzing cash flows. 

3- If you want to invest to make money, invest in mutual funds because frankly they exploit insider information to identify better stocks than you will. They know the govt. policy before it is made public. etc. etc. 

If you want to invest to learn, try building a portfolio on one of those finance sites like Yahoo finance etc. etc. In fact it may be better to pick up a mature market like US for that since there will be lot more data available for you to analyze. You don't need real cash for that ! 

My credentials are that I was in investment management business for 1 year. I have sold hedge funds and REIT's. Trust me, trading directly in stocks is dangerous, although in my stupid bravado, I still sometimes do it :( 

Log on to www.zerodha.com and create an account. They'll ask you for some ID proof etc. and then set you up with a Demat and Trading account. You can then buy Shares, Mutual Funds, Commodities, Futures and Options, and even Currency Futures. They're one of the cheapest brokerages in India. 

I currently trade with them and so far haven't had any complaints. ",Business/Finance

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

And it’s working - property tax collections are up 20% since the city began innovating its tax collection methods. It’s effective because if drummers start playing outside your house, you reputation in the community takes a hit. After all, *chaar log dekhenge to kya kahenge?*

But again still seems like a horribly distant dream. By the time it comes to fruition, I'd have probably found the one. -_-

Thanks a lot for compiling this. You, good sir, shall receive my upvote! (:


Brilliant stuff, as always.

Two things:

1) Why, according to you, is the government so eager to dip into the EPF money? From what you have written about the low-income housing scheme, do you think it's a constant effort to redirect the money towards recapitalizing failing banks?

2) PNB Q4 results will be out today. Do you have an inkling when the other banks will start declaring theirs? Sensex is already jittery, fell 250 points since morning.

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

1766,RBI slashed the interest rate on credit card dues after I sent a petition to the Honorable Prime Minister,306,2vw8p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vw8p6/rbi_slashed_the_interest_rate_on_credit_card_dues/,60,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Interest-on-card-dues-set-to-drop/articleshow/46225962.cms

This was covered by Business World magazine

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India. For the first time in our history we may actually have a cap on credit card interest rates in our country.**",1423968456.0,"My children will thank you op. Great intiative.As someone who has been in credit card debt and a bachelor of economics, I thank you. After fighting HDFC for 9 months and threatening to sue several times, the bank finally agreed to reverse unjustified charges they had been levying.

Basically, they had turned on an auto debit feature wherein my credit card dues were automatically deducted from my HDFC account every month. However, my HDFC account has always been dormant and never held any money, and my relationship manager knew this. So every time it would auto debit and every time it would fail, they would charge me 600 rupees for the failed transaction. This amounted to several thousands in just a few months.

Banks are profit-driven institutions. They are not here for financial support, they are here for business. Thank you man.

Profits at Axis Bank [fell](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/LlwW49im93N1GmvPrUm64H/Q4-results-Axis-Bank-profit-falls-for-the-first-time-in-46.html) almost 2% as bad loans went up - it’s the bank’s first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade.

Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans. Masochist shareholders of bank stocks can relax.


**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry.

And for the second time, nobody was stupid enough to make a bid. The minimum price was set at ₹367 crore. It’s safe to say - those brands are poisonous by now. The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

An RTI disclosure recently [revealed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-raghuram-rajan-not-top-paid-executive-at-rbi-report-1398885) that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, the guy that basically runs the Indian economy, is paid a gross salary of ₹1.98 lakh per month. Here’s the shocker - he’s not even the highest paid employee at RBI.

* Warren Buffett, everyone’s favourite billionaire (sorry Bill) recently livestreamed his company’s annual shareholder meeting on Yahoo. During the meeting, he showered praises upon praises on Amazon founder and fellow billionaire, Jeff Bezos. And Jeff deserves that pat on the back - As Amazon reported profits and revenues that crushed expectations back home in the United States, Amazon India [surpassed](http://www.bidnessetc.com/68048-amazon-shoves-snapdeal-aside-become-indias-2nd-largest-online-retailer/) Snapdeal to become the 2nd largest online marketplace in India after Flipkart.

* Two weeks ago, it was about Japan building India’s first bullet train. But then there’s China who wants to [build](http://techstory.in/india-high-speed-rail-network-19042016/) a second bullet train route in India, possibly a Delhi-Chennai connection. China does have the world’s largest bullet train network that it claims is profitable, but it also [has](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/india-on-5th-place-in-fake-goods-trade-china-on-top/story/232014.html) 63% market share in the global fake goods trade (India has 2%). Considering the state of Indian Railways, fake Chinese bullet trains will probably still be an upgrade.

Amazon is doing great. But Apple has seen better days. It reported a 22% fall in profits for the previous quarter. Its stock is down 15% for the month. It’s so bad that Apple CEO Tim Cook had to go on American TV to remind everyone that it’s still the most profitable company in the world. In India, things are equally grim. Market share of iPhones [dropped](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Samsung-outpaces-Apple-to-emerge-as-leader-in-Indias-premium-smartphone-segment/articleshow/52035720.cms) from 55% a year ago to just 37% today. And Samsung emerged as the leader with a 62% market share. Where are all the apple fanboys now, huh?

In a lot of the developed world, people always call out the top 1%, the richest individuals, to stop evading taxes and pay their fair share. But in India, if you do pay taxes, you are actually the 1%. Government data shows only 1.25 crore Indians [paid](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/only-1-of-india-s-population-pays-taxes-govt-data-116050200008_1.html) taxes in 2012-13 which is about 1% of the population.

###Headline Stories

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year.

A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

**IDFC and Shriram Group to finalise $10 billion mega merger within 90 days** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: IDFC and the Shriram Group have agreed to finalise within 90 days the merger of financial services business of the two groups that will create a financial supermarket with offerings from motorcycle credit to lending for multi-billion dollar power projects.IDFC Bank managing director and chief executive Rajiv Lall called the proposed merger a 'marriage made in heaven' while the founder chairman Deepak Parekh said that IDFC gets 'readymade branches’ and `hope the marriage happens’ amid likely regulatory obstacles.All the operating businesses of the two groups will come together under IDFC Ltd . The retail consumer centric business of the holding company Shriram Capital - Shriram City Union Finance - will be merged into IDFC Bank. The transport finance business will remain a standalone non-banking finance company that would become a subsidiary of IDFC Limited. The share swap ratio and other details of the merger would be worked out in the next 90 says.""In the long run, if ever there is a black swan event , you do need a fall back and that's where a bank will help"" said Ajay Piramal , the single largest individual shareholder in Shriram Group of companies.The merger of the two group of companies will create a financial giant with a market value of at least Rs. 72,000 crores which will also have businesses like mutual funds and life insurance.""It is a chance to create financial conglomerate that could become India's largest mass retail platform, to deliver full range of financial products,” said Piramal.The merger of the two group businesses may be the first of its kind in India with different businesses located in different companies. These companies straddle various regulators, from the Reserve Bank of India to the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India to the Securities & Exchange Board of India.An approval from the RBI may be the trickiest one with the central bank having expressed reservations in the past about the holding structure when it comes to banks. It had insisted all the lending businesses be brought under the bank umbrella for a universal bank license. It was averse to a bank owning lending operations in any other entity other than the bank itself.""This is a complex transaction.... will take time to execute,'' said Lall.In the case of Shriram, it owns Shriram City Union which lends to small and medium enterprises and Shriram Transport which funds trucks business. IDFC has a mutual fund, private equity, and investment banking businesses.""Our expectation is that the whole transaction that is perceived as single scheme of amalgamation, will be approved only once by our respective boards, but it will take 12 months,"" said Lall.The transaction, if it happens, would be a dream come true for both the groups. Shriram group wanted to own a bank but was not willing to toe the conditions for a universal bank license. For IDFC Bank which has been struggling to build a reasonable retail assets or liabilities franchise despite getting a universal bank license three years ago, would get millions of customers on a platter.""Shriram needs wholesale assets and IDFC needs retail assets,"" said Parekh. ""There’s a lot of work ahead.""

###Headline Stories

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

* Government offices spend around 10-20% of non-plan expenditure or roughly 1.4 lakh crore on routine office purchases like cups and saucers to laptops and printers. And the government’s purchasing arm is [considering](http://www.businessinsider.in/Government-e-Marketplace/articleshow/52652285.cms) a portal called GeM (Government e-Marketplace) that’ll let employees buy routine office purchases online. Basically, they’re making a clone of Flipkart. Because you know, using Flipkart is just too mainstream now.

* The Tata Group of companies is a big group of companies. They’ve got companies tucked away in every nook and cranny of the economy - a total of close to 100 companies, of which only 30 companies are listed on the stock exchange. That number is set to become 31, as the group [revived](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/tata-technologies-revives-ipo-plan-likely-to-raise-rs-1400-crore/articleshow/52664433.cms) plans of an IPO for Tata Technologies, the engineering and IT arm of Tata Motors. If this goes through, it’ll also be the first IPO from the Tata Group in 12 years after TCS in 2004.

* The US-India Business Council counts the big boys of the global industry like Boeing, PepsiCo, MasterCard and many more as its members. And collectively, these big boys are [investing](http://www.firstpost.com/world/modi-terms-india-new-engine-of-growth-usibc-sees-45-bn-investment-2822448.html) a total of $45 billion on expanding operations in India. It’s not just one big cheque, they’ll invest over a few years. Amazon, a member of the Council as well as a big boy, committed to investing an extra $3 billion in addition to $2 billion already invested in Amazon India. The $5 billion funding will take Amazon India past the combined funding raised by both local rivals, Flipkart and Snapdeal. 

* A hot, young investment banker in London just bought a new Jaguar Land Rover car nicknamed the ‘baby Jag’ in all cash upfront. A trucker in Uttar Pradesh just scraped together enough money to buy a light Tata truck hoping that ferrying cargo from city to city will pay for his son’s education. What do those two people have in common? They both [contributed](http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/domestic-turnaround-jlr-boost-tata-motors-net-profit-three-fold/941818) to the tripling of profit for the March quarter at Tata Motors to ₹5,177 crore.

###Footnote Stories

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

Should I move to India? Or things are not as rosy and easy as I assume them to be? Any advice is appreciated. Are the career opportunities good? Is BBA in Finance enough to get me my first job? 

I am also planning to self-teach web development and move to India mid next year. Currently, I am 22 years old.

Note: Finding a job in Thailand for a non-Thai citizen is very tough. Also, I have posted about my situation here before but for a different advice.",1489599825.0,"Bro, you're asking in the wrong place. This sub is full of people who hate India and love the West. Any answer you get here is going to be biased at best. So don't ask any life-altering questions here.

My opinion - India is neither as rosy nor as gloomy as portrayed. It all depends on what kind of work you're doing. There are opportunities to be found and lost both. I would suggest you start applying for jobs, and see what you get. Generally, people here do a masters after BBA before getting a job, and they usually get a good job after that.

If you're thinking of getting into software, India is the place to be right now in Asia. We are having some teething troubles, but we should be sailing smooth in a couple of years. If you want to make a career in software, it's either the US or India. Without England, Europe's population is too homogenous to make a serious long term career there.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

* Startups always describe themselves as the Google of this, or the Facebook of that, to the point that it’s become one of the annoying buzzwords of the startup world. While startups always envy such internet giants all year round, they didn’t last week. New rules imposing a levy (called the “Google Tax”) of 6% on anyone who does business of more than ₹1 lakh in a year with foreign online advertising services [kicked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-google-tax-kicks-in-from-today-5-things-to-know-1414318) in from last week.

Turns out, all the Garfield-esque Monday back-to-work hate might just be a myth. The Edenred-Ipsos Barometer (that's a mouthful!), a yearly survey of well-being at work, has [ranked](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-opportunities/indian-employees-say-their-workplaces-promote-wellbeing/article8674930.ece) Indians at the top when it comes to having positive feelings about work. From 14,400 people in 15 countries, 88% of Indian employees report being satisfied about their work. So if you truly hate your job with a passion - you might be in the minority.

* People do crazy things for love? Try money. Questionable ponzi schemes have taken billions as investments by promoting impossible business ventures like tree plantations and even farming emus, the flightless bird. But here’s the thing with ponzi schemes - they seem to work, until one day they don’t. New legislation [proposed](http://qz.com/695185/finally-india-wants-to-clamp-down-on-savings-schemes-that-have-duped-investors-of-billions-of-dollars/) by the government aims to streamline the process for investigating ponzi schemes and to impose strict jail terms up to 10 years for offenders.

There’s a job that the Swiss Government wants all Swiss citizens to do. And it’s ready to shell out the big bucks. How big? ₹1.7 lakh per month. It offers decent hours, doesn’t need special training and isn’t dangerous. But Swiss citizens voted with an overwhelming majority and declined the job offer. Now that I have your attention, the job isn’t tiring or gross either. The job is ...to exist. Swiss citizens [voted](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) down a universal income proposal that would guarantee a minimum income of ₹1.7 lakh/month to every Swiss citizen. Uninformed sources say, the government has decided to use that money to set up much needed mental health checkup facilities in the country.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

While the list features companies that are the crème de la crème of the world’s companies, much like the Olympic medal rankings, it is dominated by western multinationals with a few Indian companies here and there. Specifically, seven Indian companies. But the three top [ranked](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/These-Are-The-Seven-Indian-Which-Companies-Which-Made-It-To-Fortune-500-List/) are - Indian Oil (161st), Reliance (215th) and Tata Motors (226th). 

* Every e-commerce company in India needs a payment processor/digital wallet to make transactions go smoothly. For this exact purpose, Amazon acquired Emvantage, Snapdeal owns Freecharge and Paytm is a digital payment franchise in itself. So, of course Flipkart would want it’s own toy to play with. After acquiring PhonePe (a payments startup) this April, Flipkart is [investing](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/21/why-flipkart-is-building-a-670-crore-digital-payments-business/) an additional ₹670 crore in the company which is expected to start processing digital payments on Flipkart, Myntra and its logistics service, eKart in the next few weeks.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

With strong indications that the bill will be supported by all political parties, the GST bill is largely expected to pass this Wednesday. But we’re just getting started. After that, at least half of the states in India need to approve the bill for it to become operational.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Generally, we have found that entrepreneurs are very knowledgable about their particular business, but they’re very shallow in their knowledge about business practices that help drive value and efficiency.” – John McNamara

Here are all the mergers and acquisitions in the last week.

This section is dedicated to those who couldn’t make it. Those who tried, but failed. Those who raised, but burned. Those who stood, but had to sit.

* No news so far about a startup closing doors. A good news maybe.

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

* The UnMidas Touch - is what Vijay Mallya seems to be suffering from where everything that he touches just turns to poop. I know I said poop. Grow up and stop giggling. A second attempt to auction his private luxury jet [failed](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallyas-personal-jet-on-auction-only-bidder-offers-rs-1-crore-1427051) as exactly one buyer showed up and bid ₹1 crore, which was way below the minimum price of ₹152 crore. Earlier this year, attempts to auction the Kingfisher House for ₹150 crore and Kingfisher brands for ₹327 crore failed as well since no bidders showed up.

* When popular party songs overuse catchphrases like *“Party all night!”*, what they really mean to say is, *“Party till 1 AM when the bar will close and kick us out at which point the party will stop!”*. You can see the problem - it doesn’t rhyme well. But that might not matter for long. The central government [cleared](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Goodbye-curfew-hours/articleshow/52982257.cms) a law allowing restaurants, bars, shops, movie theaters and more to remain open 24x7, so you actually can party all night. Aimed at increasing employment, the law lifts the collective curfew placed on all Indians. However, the final decision to implement or ignore the change has been left to state governments.

This statistic comes in the middle of the 90-day window given by the government where it has [promised](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/sm685foUYic1odLvsTAgOI/Come-clean-by-30-September-Arun-Jaitley-to-black-money-hold.html) to not investigate anyone who declares black money, and pays a 45% tax including a penalty. But the question is - can you trust the government to honour its end of the agreement? You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

When you buy insurance, you’re really just buying a promise. A promise that you’ll get more money in case something happens.

With 12,000 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, the potential is huge. The business of delivering food is where a delay of mere minutes can turn your customer from just hungry to hungry and annoyed. And if there is one thing that the Indian Railways is known for, it is for never having any delays at all.

1788,[RANT] Reality v/s Perception about the state of affairs in Bengal (economically).,13,3rvcoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3rvcoi/rant_reality_vs_perception_about_the_state_of/,73,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No
",1446914505.0,"> i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent

That is wrong, you compared India's real growth with West Bengal's nominal growth. India's nominal growth is 11-12%...

http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/budget-2015-india-nominal-gdp-growth-seen-at-11-12201516_1316686.html

> v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

Again wrong figures lol, given that West Bengal's growth as you claimed was 10.48, how can per capita grow faster, unless West Bengal's population decreased...

Also since I have no idea how you got your figures from...


http://statisticstimes.com/economy/gdp-growth-of-indian-states.php

As you can see West Bengal is below all India average in growth...

India's growth in current prices was 15.04%, whereas West Bengal was 14.53... from 2005-2014

Now I don't really know whether to trust the rest of the numbers you provided...We all know what Mamata B did to the railways while she was the rail minister. Doesn't matter what she does for Bengal. She fucked up the entire country once already.Excellent writeup, thanks for this. If you could, edit in some sources if possible.

Stereotypes and negative perceptions are very slow to change. The CPM under Jyoti Basu has been in power for around 30 years, and there is a high chance people visited the state in that era. Which is why you still see the recurring belief that there's bandhs every day.

>The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well.

People are inherently often selfish and care about themselves primarily. The online Indian community cares much more about this sort of growth, rather than an overall increase in living standards, rural infrastructure/healthcare/education or per capita earnings.

Unfortunately people are too busy spreading FUD about West Bengal, like the [Durga Pujo ban](http://scroll.in/article/766597/ground-report-was-durga-pujo-really-banned-in-a-west-bengal-village) and trying to paint Mamata as some sort of caliphate sponsor. Or saying absolutely ridiculous things like Kolkata is being overrun with Bangladeshis thanks to Mamata. Bengali media is extremely anti-TMC (many of them are now sympathetic towards the CPM which is absurd), and the far-right media is too for obvious reasons.

Of course it's never a bed of roses when it comes to Bengal and there are a lot of problems too which definitely need to be highlighted. Mamata is often a bit too hot-headed and authoritarian, and would do well to listen to her advisors and be more measured when talking to the media. Actually this is something she has improved on.
And there's still the worry that since a lot of CPM cadres moved over to the TMC, they brought with them the same thuggish goonda politics:

http://www.firstpost.com/politics/west-bengal-poll-violence-why-this-trend-wont-stop-965611.html

Corruption is also a big problem in the TMC, and the sharada scam investigation got completely scuttled. Of course problems like this exist in most states that are at a similar stage of development, and one of the good things about bengal is communal and caste conflict and polarization is substantially lower.",Business/Finance

1790,Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,37,2gg76m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gg76m/heres_why_india_shouldnt_adopt_the_nordic_welfare/,105,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/9YhKdaE.png

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/lDeXvnX.png

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

What do you think ?",1410808354.0,"Norway has oil money, we don'tThe real reason is that population of all these Nordic countries is most of the time less than that of mohallas like Doddanekundi, Malviya Nagar and AdyarRegarding your inequality argument:

* The per capita income of USA and Nordic countries are around the same. (Except Norway, due to oil money it becomes much higher).
* You have stated that bottom 10% are at the same level.
* And that ""The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts.""
* Then who exactly gets less income?
* If all sections of the population are at same or higher level then how is the per capita GDP same?

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

After being hit by a fat tax in Kerala, Domino’s India is hoping to juice up the bottom line with its latest [invention](http://mashable.com/2016/07/15/pizza-burger-dominos-india/#72N3L.yMJSqk) - the BurgerPizza, which looks like a burger and tastes like a pizza. Because sometimes, a regular pizza just isn’t cool enough. However, with prices starting at ₹89, early reviews have been mixed. First, terrorists attack France again, then there’s an attempted military coup in Turkey and now Domino’s launches BurgerPizza. What is even happening in the world right now.

> * After the initial growth in job creation under the Prime Ministers Employment Generation Program (PMEGP) since its launch in 2008-09, the numbers have been on a decline after 2011-12.

> * (The) Number of projects under PMEGP decreased mainly due to slow process of loan sanctions by banks which translated into weak result in employment generation, said Arun Kumar Jha, chief executive officer of KVIC.Earlier, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) had asked the Finance Ministry regarding slower sanctions of bank loans and delay in disbursement of margin money that had put pressure on progress of the scheme.The maximum cost of the project admissible under manufacturing sector is Rs 25 lakh and for business and services sector it is Rs 10 lakh.As per the data, in the year 2011-12 under PMEGP 55,135 projects had been financed by the government while the same decreased to 18,141 in 2014-15.

> * Moreover, for the success of such a programme, the government needs to involve industry at the time of implementation as well.Ajoy Bhattacharya, vice president, All India Confederation of Small & Micro Industries Associations (AICOSMIA) said, ""Most of the time MSMEs are not so prepared to tackle problems that occur all of sudden which make them defaulter in banks.

> * ""It is also necessary to include industry personnel to implement such projects as they can be a bridge between government and industry who understand the both,"" Bhattacharya added.The PMEGP applicant is required to bring in his own contribution of 10 per cent of the project cost (5 per cent for SC/ST and other weaker sections) with banks sanctioning loan for the balance 90 or 95 per cent of the project cost.

###Headline Stories
***

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

* From purchasing an eraser to issuing a press release, the government’s bureaucracy machine is known for setting up panels and committees and sub-committees and commissions to oversee everything. But not for finding a replacement for Raghuram Rajan. Jesus Christ, are we still on him? Yes, we’re still on him. The Prime and Finance Ministers are expected to [handpick](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/pm-narendra-modi-and-fm-arun-jaitley-to-select-raghuram-rajans-successor-not-a-panel/articleshow/52842311.cms) the next governor of RBI, and the news has it that they’re looking for a person with a background in economics rather than policy.

* Get ready to feel gross in your wet sandals and tip toe your way to the bathroom as soon as you get home... the monsoon is [here](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/monsoon-finally-arrives-in-drought-hit-maharashtra-90-of-state-receiving-rains-met-dept/). After being late by a week, the rains have covered more than half of the country as regions previously hit by droughts have begun getting rainfall. For farmers, this means the need to plant summer crops and for investors, this means that at least we have something to counter Brexit’s effects.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

* After a political campaign that ended with the exit of the RBI Governor, MP Subramanian Swamy is the talk of the town. And now, he has [trained](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/subramanian-swamy-now-targets-cea-arvind-subramanian-after-raghuram-rajan-exit-2868336/) his guns on Chief Economic Advisor to the government, Arvind Subramanian. In a salvo of tweets, Swamy stated that Arvind should be fired immediately. For there can only be one Subramanium.

And the award for this week’s most bizarre economic story goes to: LG Electronics India, who is [rolling](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/lg-electronics-sells-mosquito-repelling-tv-india-n594251) out TVs that come with mosquito repellent technology. The TV, which also keeps mosquitoes away when switched off, costs ₹26,500 and keeps mosquitoes that can cause diseases like malaria, zika, dengue away. Or if you think cure is better than prevention, just buy dengue insurance. Yeah, they sell those too. [Really](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/your-money/tomorrowmakersshow/48985928.cms).

US technology is no longer just about smartphones and facebook apps, it’s also about sex-sorted bovine semen. The government is in [talks](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/modi-government-looks-to-us-technology-for-increasing-domestic-cows-milk-output/articleshow/52787849.cms) with a few US-based companies that have the technology for ‘sex-sorted semen’ which ensures only female cattle are born through assisted reproduction. This comes as part of a project that aims to increase milk production and make it more profitable for the farmers of India. Feminism may not be working out for the women of India, but it’s really taking off for the cows of India.

When Adani’s son was married in Goa is 2013, guest list included the richest man in the country and many a chief executive and top banker and bureaucrat. Most, however, just stopped by the night before to bless the happy couple and skipped the actual wedding. But one prominent friend stayed through all the ceremonies over a couple of days, genial and relaxed like a favorite uncle. It was Narendra Modi, chief minister of Adani's home state of Gujarat.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

Adani, has travelled with Modi in the past year more than any other billionaire, helping him emerge as the most prominent face of India Inc. to the wider world. His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite. He travelled with Modi to US, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Japan, France and China. After most of Modi’s foreign visits, Adani bagged business agreement from these countries.

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)",1500660466.0,Adani is BJP's Vadra.Are you surprised?

There are **four possible explanations**:

1. The epidemic may have struck later than in other countries. Since epidemics have exponential growth at the start, a small delay can have massive effects on the number of cases.
2. India’s 21-day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic. Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and, if anything, many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard.
3. India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths. Without sufficient testing, many deaths may not be labeled with Covid-19 for official statistics, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis.
4. India may have protective characteristics against Covid-19. Researchers have proposed that the low share of elderly in the population, the high temperatures and humidity in India, widespread BCG vaccination for tuberculosis, or resistance to malaria have helped India escape the brunt of the pandemic.",Coronavirus

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?

Bengaluru:

> A quarantine team of health workers and policemen was targeted last evening in west Bengaluru by a large mob of about 200 locals when the officials reached a neighbourhood to take 58 people who were believed to have come in contact with three coronavirus patients. They were forced to retreat leaving behind 33 people who had to be taken to the isolation units.

> A ward in West Bengaluru's Padarayanapura locality was sealed last week after three people, who had attended a congregation in Delhi's Nizammudin in March, tested positive for coronavirus. The congregation held by Tablighi Jamaat has set off the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases in India; more than 4,000 cases across the country have been linked to the congregation so far.

> As the team reached the neighbourhood at around 7 pm, angry locals started removing tin sheets that were erected as barricades to mark the sealed area. 

> In videos shot on mobile phones, the locals are seen damaging tents installed for healthcare workers and policemen.

> Fifty-four people have been arrested over the incident so far, including those who had to be taken to isolation units. Among those arrested is a woman who is believed to have instigated the group of locals. 

> ""No healthcare worker was attacked... only some damage to the property has been reported. The locals were demanding on-the-spot testing,"" senior police officer B Ramesh said. It took a few hours for the officials concerned to bring the situation under control.

> Union Minister Prahlad Joshi condemned the attack in a tweet.

> Several attacks have been reported in the past few weeks against the health workers and those in the frontline in the fight against coronavirus.

> Last week, a group of sanitation worker in Madhya Pradesh were attacked by a mob of locals in Dewas district when they went to a neighbourhood to clean the streets. In Bihar, four such cases of attack on health workers were reported across the state within 24 hours on Thursday.

> Across India, more than 16,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, more than 500 people have died.Seriously though, why can’t they test on the spot?

The advisory asked people not to spread on  social media the names, identity or the locality of those affected by  the virus or under quarantine. It also urged people to avoid spreading  fear and panic.

The advisory came after a spurt in coronavirus  cases following a religious congregation organised by the Tablighi  Jamaat at its Markaz or headquarters in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, and  instances of people blaming the Muslim community for the spread of the  disease.",1587430238.0,,Coronavirus

If the lockdown is lifted, hospitals will be overwhelmed and healthcare professionals will be affected. If more children fall sick because schools re-open, who will the parents blame? 

I think a lockdown is one of the more prudent things a government can do.

They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects. Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer.

**Ingredients:**

1-liter water

100 neem leaves10-20 basil leaves10 grams alum10 grams camphorAloe vera

&#x200B;

**Procedure**:

* First, put 100 grams of neem leaves in 1 liter of water.
* After that, add basil leaves and boil them well in water. Now put aloe vera in it.
* When the water boils well and about 600 to 700 mL of 1 liter is left, then add camphor and alum in it.

Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome.

Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians.

You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely.> Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket 

These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don't want that. 

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company.> Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines? If startups don't learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet.",Coronavirus

> 
> During January 26–February 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters. The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.

r/COVID19 post: https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g3sgcf/covid19_outbreak_associated_with_air_conditioning/

Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperature+humidity.

Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/transmission/

> Humidity (best if between 50% and 80%)
> 
> ""It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane"" [source] Relative humidity (RH, or Saturation Ratio: the state of vapor equilibrium in room air) affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses, independent of their source (respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid) and location (in air or settled on surfaces). Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission. [source]
> 
> ""Measurements of indoor humidities in 40 residential apartments in New York (19) and in 6 high-quality commercial buildings in the Midwest (20) showed indoor vapor pressure of below 10 mb or indoor RH of below 24% in the winter"" [source]
> 
> Experiments conducted in a study indicated ""a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH (20–50%), while the stability of summer or all-year viruses enhanced at higher RH (80%)"" [source]

Therefore, while our population size, education/awareness and density are strong disadvantages to us, **maybe** there is some advantage to be had if we **stop using air-conditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible**. 

This is speculation, but I believe **it merits proper investigation**.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

1950,What HT Wouldn't Publish: The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi,17,g43omc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g43omc/what_ht_wouldnt_publish_the_folly_and_vanity_of/,3,"[Ramachandra Guha's article on The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/central-vista-project-delhi-covid-19)

Narendra Modi's project for the Central Vista was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable.  

*Six years ago, the then editor of the* Hindustan Times  *invited me to write a fortnightly column. I agreed, on condition that  there would be no censorship. While occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent, there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments. Until this week, when the* Hindustan Times *declined to print the column I had sent, which was scheduled to appear on Sunday, April 19. I am grateful to* The Wire *for carrying this column in its entirety.* 

In a two-part article published last month in the website *Newslaundry*, the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi’s Central Vista to critical scrutiny. The [first part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/16/pms-house-on-rajpath-how-a-super-elite-is-capturing-delhis-land)  asked the question: “Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capital’s catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?”

In answering this question, Kishore focused on one key element in the  project: the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister, on  Rajpath. Such self-indulgence, she argued, may be common in  dictatorships, but was inappropriate for a Republic. If one thinks of  Delhi as akin to London or Berlin, a capital of a *democracy*, then, argues Kishore, spending hundreds of crores “on a second house for the prime minister *ahead*  of fixing Delhi’s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the people’s good. On the other hand, if we are in the  Beijing-Pyongyang-Moscow axis where citizens are passive spectators, it  is absolutely normal.”

The [second part](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/17/gujarat-model-20-the-super-elites-magic-wand-to-take-over-public-space)  of Kishore’s article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded: a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge, ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister. This firm’s previous projects,  wrote Kishore, had depended for their execution  “upon the removal of  “obstacles” like due process, impact assessments, public consultation,  and well-established global best practices”. The firm’s past record, in  sum, was one of consistently manifesting “an innate disrespect for the  citizen”.

In concluding her two-part essay, Kishore remarked:

“The biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  Rajpath, no less, to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy. Would Emmanuel Macron demand and, more importantly, *get*  a house on the Champs Elysées? Can even Trump order himself a second  home on the Mall? She added: ‘It brings back embarrassing memories of  his name-embroidered Rs 10-lakh suit, only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayer’s expense.”

Kishore’s essay has no mention of the COVID-19 crisis; evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known. I shall  come to this crisis presently, but let me first state that I share her  concerns entirely. This project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public, or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planning.

In fact, as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  Ahmedabad at first-hand, I have an additional concern: that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage. A prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad.  The original IIM-A campus, designed by Louis Kahn, beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices, using red brick, open windows, and  courtyards. It is a joy to see, walk through, study and teach in. Its  successor is cold and soulless, built entirely of concrete; those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campus.

The prime minister’s own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the 75th anniversary  of Indian independence. This is disingenuous, because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza. Both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked, by a special session of parliament. Apparently,  what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and I.K. Gujral wouldn’t quite do  for Narendra Modi.

To my mind, the Modi government’s redesign of New Delhi brings to  mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African  despots. It is the sort of vanity project, designed to perpetuate the  ruler’s immortality, that Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and  Jean Bédel-Bokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on  their own countries (for more on the first, see V.S. Naipaul’s essay ‘[The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/05/14/the-crocodiles-of-yamoussoukro)’).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us, this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and self-indulgent  exercise. It has now become much more so. For, an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic. The  ill-planned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering. Working-class  Indians, already living on the edge, are now faced with utter  destitution.  

As many economists have argued, the millions of poor Indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central  government. Why can’t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista  scheme – estimated at Rs 20,000 crore and counting – be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?

Politically, the burden of this economic, social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states. They desperately need money – not  least, the money the Centre already owes them. A staggering Rs 30,000  crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of  Goods and Services Tax revenues. Why does this still remain unpaid,  while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?

It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover. The restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer. Altogether, the country may take at least five, more  likely ten, years before it can return to where it was before COVID-19  came to our shores. Surely the moral, political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuilding.

In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke, the prime  minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their  time, their jobs, their lifestyles, their human and cultural tendency to  be gregarious. Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice  something for the nation as well. His project to redesign Central Vista  was always controversial. It is now absolutely untenable. He should drop  it.

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",1587224849.0," *This is not a shitpost*   
/sI appreciate your love and appreciation for India and its people but I do want to concede that it's too romantic and is based more on ignorance than knowledge.

India decided to export hydroxychloroquine not because of goodwill or selflessness but because it was pressured by the close allies of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi like Donald Trump, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, and even threatened with retaliation. And our prime minister, being a good man he is (not actually but he likes to pretend as one), complied to his camaraderie's request and revoked the decision to suspend the export of the said drug.

The whole of India has been in lockdown since March 24 and will remain so till May 3 which will possibly be extended and only essential services are operational. And so the labour force you talked about has either been locked indoor or driven from their home because their livelihood has been disrupted. And I highly doubt there's enough inventories in India to produce emergency gears for the world, let alone for India.

The Indian government certainly didn't put its citizens first. When the world was hit by the coronavirus and governments the world over were planning what should be done, the Indian government was busy trying to topple a state government (they did succeed in doing that btw). And when they announce that the whole country will be locked down, it was done so without any prior information and the whole country was in disarray as a result. The sudden and unplanned manner of the implementation of the lockdown might have done more harm than good. Thousands from the cities where people are more likely to be affected huddled together to train stations and bus terminal to go to their respective towns and villages. Many decided to walk homes, some of which are over 200 km away, and some of them died of exhaustion.

I'm not sure if you still reading, but I want to say that no government, except South Korea and some other East Asian nations, has handled this pandemic well, and India is no exception. Nations need to cooperate more than ever but most seem to be self-interested and competing one another even for emergency kits. Lots of lessons to be learned.

1978,A dilemma,1,g3ry8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3ry8v/a_dilemma/,2," I know There are similar posts right now on this topic but i am posting this here because i have  asked this  question on Quora and I haven't gotten any answer.I hope I can get an answer on this site.       
 
  So this is about my brother who is an assistant manager in a PSU (public sector undertaking).Its a good secure job but there is a strong  chance  that this company might be privatised within 10 years.After passing out from his college my brother  was placed in an IT Company but he didn't  take that  up  because he wanted a secure govt. job.His CGPA is 8.2 and gre score  is 334 so he is very sure he will  get admission to a tier 1 university.   

His first problem is that he is a EC (electronics and communication)graduate and doesn't have much knowledge of computer science and doesn't have any significant coding experience.The only  language he knows is C++.  So he is concerned whether he will be able to cope up acdemically.
 The second (possible) obstacle is his age.He is almost 30 years old now and by the time he will have completed his MS he will be 32.Will this be a problem in getting a job in the US?( he doesn't want a job in India)
  
Our third concern is the current scenario in US with the coronavirus and possible  changes to the H1b visa process.Will this affect his chances  ?  
.Is it worth risking a secure  job for this opportunity?is it feasible?",1587261862.0,"What's he going to do after his H1B is gone in 6 years? It's unlikely he'll get sponsored for a green card through his employer and even if that does happen he'll be stuck with that employer for decades while the application is in processing.

The first thing I'd do in this situation is apply for Canadian permanent residence through express entry: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html

Also, it's going to be very tough to get a job offer as someone who isn't even in the country - and coming on a B1/B2 visa to get a job is a very risky undertaking.30-35 is not too late to do an MS. However given the current situation, I wouldn’t assume that H1B jobs will be available. That said, graduating from a well-regarded MS program has value in itself even if you don’t get a job in the US. And you should never assume that you will — the H1B process is very capricious.

If one relishes a challenging academic program in a great environment — sure, go for the MS. Be prepared to work hard, like really hard, in an environment where your peers are amongst the smartest people you’ve met.

I’d go do the MS if it were me. But the COVID quarantines do introduce a lot of uncertainty. Whereas the PSU option is great for a more relaxed life. In any case, upon PSU privatisation, VRS is likely to be available.

PS. The ECE thing isn’t a problem necessarily. A lot of tech courses involve hardware too, for which an ECE background is very useful. I’d say, steer away from pure-CS programs and instead focus on computer engineering, chip design, or computer systems design as those will play to his strengths.",Coronavirus

- Meanwhile, The Indian Express has asked employees to take pay cuts. On 1 April, in an email to employees, CEO George Varghese wrote: “Vendors are insecure, RWAs (Resident Welfare Association) are insecure, the rail, road and air lockdown has grounded distribution, businesses are shut down, we have been compelled to reduce print orders in all centres.”

- On 10 April, Hindi News channel News Nation fired its entire English digital team of 15 journalists, despite the Narendra Modi government’s advisory urging public and private companies to not cut salaries or fire people during the lockdown.

- The Times of India has also allegedly sacked its entire Sunday magazine team. In a Facebook post, journalist Nona Walia claimed: “The entire team of Sunday magazine of Times of India asked to leave. Got a call from my boss Poonam Singh.

Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?

If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

Instead what we have now is a system that threatens every single move we make because others are ALLOWED by us to use their powers against us!

Counter Argument - But BJP lost in Jharkhand!

Opposing View - BJP would have lost by an even bigger margin in Jharkhand had paper ballots been used.

&#x200B;

I think the CAA, NRC, NPR protest is at a stage now that it can be used to rope in related issues and expand the reach of protests to meet demands which should have been granted to us long ago.

The Expanded Five point demand by protesters should be :-

1. Roll back CAA. Population census is fine (under Census Act 1948), it does not come under the ambit of Citizenship Act of 1955. However, NPR and NRIC do come under the ambit of Citizenship Act - the government should say that they do not intend to go through with the exercise of NPR and NRIC in their current term - until 2024.
2. Jobs, water and affordable food - where are ""achche din""? This was all promised by the government.
3. Ban EVM from all forms of elections in India - only paper ballots.
4. Police involved in manhandling of CAA protesters and breaking protester's property should be indicted in fast trial courts.
5. State government should compensate families of victims abused by the police.

&#x200B;

The protesters should not stop protesting unless all these demands are met summarily - we need to tell the government this time  who really holds the power.

If we do not demand justice, we will never receive it - current India is by no means a ""Ram Rajya""!",1577678229.0,"Add the Data Protection Bill in this.

How does it feel like watching someone getting amputated, blinded, beaten by lathis and Tear-gassed while fighting for your Rights?

\-1) \[Coz fuck you Natural Numbers\] Govt is trying to give these protests a communal angle. DONT fall for their trap. Many international news have also claimed this being anti-muslim, try to clear things as much as possible. Assam wants every illegal migrant out, be it Muslim, Hindu or Sikh. And I support that. But everyone should be given fair trial and Govt should give those legal citizens of India which are not in NRC full support to procure documents of proof. 

CAA+NRC+NPR are not Anti-Muslim, they are Anti-India and Anti-Constitution. **Our founding fathers i.e. Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad, Sukhdev, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Neta Ji and many many more, all wanted a Secular India and they formulated this Constitution (and Article 14 in that) and set the guideline for the future course of our nation. We owe our Freedom to them and we should respect their Principles**. By going against the spirit of our Constitution we are disrespecting them. If we start questioning their decisions, then we have gone too astray and are not worth being called an Indian.

1) Go through this article to understand what is going on **behind the scenes at BJP HQ**. How they are planning to communalize the country.

[https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims](https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims)

2) Also, keep in mind that the new evil is NPR, a rebranded NRC exercise. They have added 2 new questions to the census-based on Nationality of Parents and details of Passport

3) Data Protection Bill has already been introduced in Lok Sabha. Go through it. Summary at  [https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html)  I think after we get success on CAA we should continue the momentum and protest on other issues as well.

4) I don't have any personal experience of getting beaten by Lathis, though I have participated in protests earlier in my life. I would suggest the protestors to wear at least 4-5 layers of thick clothing so as to minimize the effect of Lathis. Heck, we are a nation of Cricket fanatics.. why don't we wear Helmets and Cricket Pads underclothes and protest? 

5) For past few days, while having a discussion with fairly educated people, I saw some of the biases in these people eg. Muslims are bad people (*Eureka!*), Muslims have beard (*WTF? Sikhs have too, so you'll go behind them next?*), Muslims are extremists, America also censors them (*US censors a lot of other people too for eg your Kaka*),  [Hindus went from 23% to 7% in Pak, which is false](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12)  ( [Another report, choose which one you want to believe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50720273) ) . It's pretty normal to have bias and I don't blame these people as I too had these bias at some point of time but then sense prevailed. Any community of people looks at another community with suspicion, and when most of the Political and Film fraternity has been painting you with a single colour, it is bound to happen. 

Don't let this narrative get to you. **Bad people are there in every religion**, be it Christians, Hindus, Muslims or Sikh or even Buddhists. There are Christian terrorists, sikh terrorists, hindu terrorists, buddhist terrorists and muslim terrorists. Just because there are terrorists in some religion doesn't mean all the followers of that religion are evil or terrorists. 

6) This whole fucking exercise is actually bad for Non-muslims. **Rs. 1900 crore has already been spent by State for Assam NRC**. Govt has cut Rs. 3000 crore from Education budget. What do you estimate it will cost to do the same NRC exercise nationwide. Any guesses? Hint: There are 28 States in India. 

Growth is already low, Inflation is increasing, All sectors are down. It doesn't take a genius to know, such divisions and instigation on communal lines will only lead to communal riots which will affect many innocent Non-muslim and Muslim families country-wide and Govt will not come to their help. 

PS. I am not from Delhi but I am planning to shift to Delhi in January to dedicate myself to active protest and continue the momentum further. Meanwhile, I am trying to help my brothers and sisters on ground by spreading awareness through social media.

It also doesn't mean that it would give  citizenship of India to these persecuted minorities very smoothly, No  never they can attain Indian citizenship only on the basis of the proper  process of naturalisation, if they will failed in this process then  they can't attain the Indian citizenship.  
>  
>Don't interpreted the CAA with **NRC**  because the CAA has nothing to do with NRC, the legal provisions of the  NRC have been part of the Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004.  Also there are specific statutory rules of 2003 to operationalise these  legal provisions. They govern the process of registration of Indian  citizens and issuance of national identity cards to them. These legal  provisions have been on the statute book since last 15–16 years. The CAA  has not altered them in any way whatsoever. Don't interpreted it like  that illegal Hindus outside and inside India will be protected via the  CAA and muslims will be discriminated, no not at all, both illegal  Hindus and Muslims claim for Indian citizenship equally via the process  of naturalisation, where CAA will not given blanket protect to Hindus.  
>  
>Don't  interpreted the CAA in the context of Ahmadiyas in Pakistan, hazaras in  Afghanistan and illegal rohingyas in India because Ahmadiyas in  Pakistan are in majority and they believe in the Pakistani version of  Islam and not maintain the level of minority same as hazaras in  Afghanistan stand in the internal context of their governance and  rohingyas are hostile community at international level and they are the  native of the neighbouring countries and they are illegally stable in  India without the citizenship of India and they will be identified under  the NRC for the purpose of deporting at their place.

&#x200B;

The  pretext of your answer assumes that since the countries mentioned in  the CAA (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) have failed to protect  their minorities, and henceforth, failed to keep-up with the  Nehru-Liaquat pact, and since these people might share ancestry  with/were born in pre-1947 India, it’s the responsibility of the Indian  State to protect them.

However, Afghanistan wasn’t a part of the partition, and nor of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. Why have them under the same belt then?

In  that case, if we’re opening our doors to religiously-persecuted  minorities from other countries (which is a good thing), why not include  Muslims and other non-Hindu minorities from Nepal (which was a Hindu  Rashtra until as late as 2008), and non-Sinhalese people from Sri Lanka?

You  also seem to contradict your statement when it comes to Rohingyas (who  according to Amnesty International, are the most persecuted minority in  the World), Hazaras or Ahmadiya Muslims (you exclude Ugyur Muslims too)  citing that they are Muslims (and thus, constitute majority in their  respective country). Please note that Ahmadiyas aren’t even considered  Muslims in Pakistan, and CAA can, very flexibly, be extended to support them.

Why is it a factor for us that they belong to the majority?

Let me tell you - because, as of current version of CAA, it does NOT mention *“religious persecution”*  at all. It just says that if you belong to <INSERT ALLOWED  RELIGIONS>, and were in India in b/w <INSERT DATES>, you shall  be offered Indian citizenship.

Now, if they’d include Muslims too, entire citizenry of Pakistan would have a free pass to Indian citizenship.

I’m  all in for greater humanitarian interests of supporting refugees, but  all of this evidence points out that this step from government is a  petty tactic for winning the Bengal elections (by the support from  Bangladeshi Hindus and other immigrants).

>There  is argument of the constitutional obligation on CAA then understand it  broadly, there is no any provision of CAA has been violated any articles  of the Constitution of India include Article 14 as well. Understand  it---

But where equals and  unequal are treated differently, the Article 14 does not mean that all  laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws  should **apply**  to all persons. It does not mean that every law must have universal  application for, all person are not, by nature, attainment or  circumstances in the same position.  
>  
>**Article** **5 to 11** **(under** **PART-2)**  are the only articles of the Constitution of India that deal with the  context of Citizenship, where Article 11 state that it grant of  citizenship shall be subject to any further law that the parliament may  passed in this particular regards, its the only union parliament which  have the power in this particular issue, it is not within the domain of  states. In the context of Citizenship Article 5 to 11 of the  Constitution of India shall read along with the Citizenship Act of 1955  coupled with the foreigners Act of 1946 that deal with the who is the  foreigner of as far as India's concern.

It’s not that this bill is ‘*literally*’  targeting the constitution of India, but it’s hurting it’s principles  of equality in the sense that the Indian Government is judging people  (and I quote you) by *“level of minority”*,  and that too, falsely. Religious discrimination faced against the Tamil  people in Sri Lanka, or the pain of Ugyurs in China is no-less than the  plight of Hindu people in Pakistan.

Also,  you comment that we shouldn’t tie up CAA with NRC. However, there are  two main reasons that I can cite in favor of studying CAA in light of  NRC:

* Firstly, the Home Minister, at least in 7 of his recent speeches, has always spoken of them together.
* Secondly,  and more importantly, because, assuming the NRC pan India will be  similar to assam, it will give extreme discretionary powers to local  authorities, who have the power to claim ANYONE (not Muslims, not  Hindus, not Christians, yes anyone) as ""doubtful citizens"". The basis of  such a conclusion is vague, and hence extremely exploitative. It’s like  giving them \[the Registrar\] a free pass to exploit the poor, or  anyone/any community they hold grudges against. Don’t we already have  enough of it?  
Not to forget, it can be used as a tool to suppress  dissent - If you dare say anything against the government, they’d have  the authority to strip you off of your citizenship. This pain might be  less for non-Muslims because if they are rich, they can hope to claim  citizenship under the CAA (*cough* bribe *cough*).

The  sea of reasons mentioned here are enough for people to oppose a bill.  The NRC is tangential to this discussion, but forms a very important  base of the ongoing protests.

Also,  these protests aren’t just against CAA, or the NRC, or NPR for that  matter. It’s also against the brutality with which the police took  action against the protestors. Among all other things, it is also to  assert our right to dissent, and to assert the fact that people’s  opinion has a rightful place in a democracy, which given the current  government’s stance, they are crumbling. (Just today \[Jan. 3. '20\], Home  Minister said that they wouldn’t move an inch backwards on CAA.)

>“CAA is not in the context of stripping the Citizenship of any Indian Citizen and their fundamental rights”  
 

You also wrongly quote the Arabic Kalma - *“La Ilaha Illallah”* sprayed on the wall in Jamia. It literally means *“Ekam brahmasmi, dutiya nasti”*,  which if you’d be Hindu enough to read Brahma Sutra you’d know means,  “There’s just one God. None other.” People might call it 'Brahma',  'Ishwara', 'Bhagwan', 'Allah', 'God', a tree, or whatever - but it’s ultimately one (An idea which is  popular even in a religion such as Hinduism which is known for it’s many  gods – Many Hindu school of thoughts subscribe to worshiping idols, but  the belief across Sanatana Dharma (even in the Nastika philosophy) is  to believe in the absolute - *'Brahmand'*).

Also,  you talk about violence in the protests. I cannot speak for everywhere,  but from the news reports, it seems that most (and the largest)  gatherings against CAA-NRC-NPR are peaceful. Even if there was violence,  the brutality with which the police is reacting doesn’t justify any of  it. (Raping minors, killing people!!).

There  have been reports of how people have been planted in the mob to  instigate violence - you know who this would benefit - definitely, not  the protestors.

In the end, I’d like to quote you:

# First Step - CENSUS [aka NPR]

Some govt. officials will visit your place and will ask you the following questions

1. Your name
2. Your Date of Birth
3. Your parent's name and place of birth
4. Some sort of paper just to confirm your identity, ""NOTHING RELATED TO YOUR CITIZENSHIP"" such as maybe your Aadhar number, Voter ID card.

# Second Step - The D factor [Doubtful Citizen]

After a few months, all the data from NPR will be collected and some Government officials will check the whole list and if you weren't able to answer a few questions such as - Your Parent's exact age, their DoB, your own Aadhar number just because it's been month you applied and haven't received it or any other reason not mentioned here then that official will simply put a ""D"" in front of your name i.e. Doubtful Citizen.

# Third Step - NRC

If your name is in the new filtered list of Doubtful Citizens then you will have to ""Prove your Citizenship""

How?

The government has not published any such guidelines as per now but we can understand from the example of Assam: Aadhar Card, Name in the Voter list, name in Ration card list can nothing prove your Citizenship, It was also said by Amit Shah repeatedly in his speeches and interviews recently.

Source: [https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/](https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/) \[The link also has a video interview, Just in case if you like watching his face and listening to his voice, otherwise believe me and read further\]

You will have to present documents which should prove where you were born 30 years ago if you were not born then you will have to show the documents of your parents or grandparents, any property documents maybe. If you are able to provide the proofs then you are safe, If not then you will be filtered out once again, Hence the 4th step.

# Fourth Step - Foreigners Tribunal

This will be your last chance to prove that you are Citizen of  Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan, If you are Muslim then you stand no chance because CAA will be activated here even if you prove that you were a citizen of any of the above countries. If others are not able to prove their Citizenship then they will also be labeled as Foreigners.

# Fifth Step - Detention Centers [JAIL FOR FOREIGNERS]

6 detention centers are already functioning in Assam, Constructions of detention Centers has already begun in other states.

**~~\[NSFW\]~~**  I typed a long paragraph about the life in the Detention Center but then  I realized that you guys like Truth but do not the BRUTAL HONESTY. So let's skip that part.

# How to stop this 5-step plan?

It's VERY SIMPLE, As soon the government begins with the first step we need to boycott it immediately because once people are filtered out then it will be too easy for the government to handle us because then they have to handle only a few of use and they exactly know which one of us.

You are not alone, ""We the people of India"" is a group formed by more than 120 organizations throughout the country has given a call to boycott the NPR \[Press release attached at the end\]

How to boycott this process:

If officials visit your place then don't be angry on them, They are not Sanghi (some of them might be), They are the government officials who will be doing this government survey, Offer them water, tea, ask them to even have a seat if you would like that but just politely tell them that you won't be sharing any details with them as it is unconstitutional, Don't give any papers, Don't share any information with them verbally. They will try to tell you that it's a Government survey and it's unconstitutional but take a stand and deny the information politely.

Now I know very well that a lot of my fellow Hindu brothers and ~~sisters~~ females might be thinking that I will give them the papers because mom-dad will yell at me but yeah I will stand against this CAA and NPR during protests, I will go to Shaheen Bagh, No way. It won't work that way, The government will start picking up people one by one after that because just for an example If 1000 people are living in a locality then 770 might show papers then they have to handle only 30 people now, They very well know how to handle 30 people.

I am leaving a video in the comments sections, The same concept explained in Hindi by Yogendra Yadav, share that video with your Driver, Servant, Vegetable Vendor or anyone you know might not have the papers despite caring about their religion. It might change someone's perspective.

This guard was talking to a college kid. He said ""Saale bahar se aake yaha do manjila ghar bana liye hain .. ab sabit karo .. show karna padega isiliye inki fati padi hai (for protestors)."" .. so I could not resist and intervene, asked him how would you prove your citizenship? he said I have adhaar PAN card etc. .. When I told him, this wouldn't work you would have to furnish the birth certificate of not only your’s, but your father’s, and every member of family .. he said I know some Vidhayak ji and went to this Bhokal attitude. I also asked him if he actually believes that landless labours in village and many people in rural areas would have any kind of paper to support their citizenship ?? and how much of corruption, scam would take place … He still kept on denying by presenting his Bhokal of knowing this Vidhayak and “sab nikalwa lunga”.

So the second logic I am presenting is, If PRO NPR/CAA/NRC guys argue that this law is for giving citizenship and not taking away, why do they so vehemently oppose **reservations**?!?!? Because it provides job to the needy and does not takes anyone’s job .. ask any BJP supporter out there and he’ll tell you how much he hates this reservation thing .. and yet he takes this contrasting stand when it comes to NRC/NPR/CAA.",1578667058.0,"They have only filled mind with gobar in past 6 years.

Moreover most of the talk about the pogroms is emotionally charged gossip. The AAP's complicity by not taking any action at all, and failing miserably with connecting with public, is conveniently being neglected. AAP needs to make amends. We can still look up to AAP in the hope that they are unlike BJP.

The onus should not be on the victims to be left to fight for themselves.  When all the institutions of the establishment fail, the civil society must to step in. Some altruistic people are already taking good steps by volunteering relief material but the scale is abysmal. The victims are left at the benevolence of a few, the state is turning away, the judiciary is abdicating from its responsibilities. Like what kinda mess is this. I hope more people can offer help other than just pity and the state addresses the situation with the urgency that it begs. 


Aside from that, we must remind ourselves that the CAA, NPR and NRC monster is still lurking. It hasn't gone away. India isn't in good hands. The establishment is trying too hard to suppress dissent and they seem to get away with every illegal thing they do. They have a great sense of entitlement. But the protests must go on to protect the idea of India our forefathers had envisioned, to protect the values enshrined in our constitution.

the minority of the total population of the country. There is still the majority of the people who
continue their lives as normal and have not commented on this issue. 
These protests are said to be driven by the youth but the youth we are seeing protesting are only a small fraction of the total youth. Even among the social workers and NGO workers there are only a small fraction of them who are commenting or sharing their support on social media. 
This is a major issue asthese people are uncaring and unconcerned not just about this issue but other major issues unless it directly affects and impacts them. They are also fearful and a bit lazy for not reading up on these issues and thus not understanding their importance and consequences.
There have been attempts during these protests to shame these people into showing their
support however by and large the majority of society still remains quiet and continuing their lives
as usual.
There needs to be more engagement by this section of the society as they cannot be neutral or
unconcerned with the ruling party doing door to door campaigns about the CAA and NRC/NPR
and also encouraging the people to call a number to show their support for it. 
They should thennot complain when the time comes when they are forced to stand in long queues with theirdocuments and told that they can't be put on the NRC/NPR or have to hunt for their documents and pay a huge amount for them to agents and those in the government offices.
 The teachers, concerned workers and others with knowledge on this issue need to engage with the people on this issue and try to get these people more involved or at least more enlightened.",1578409312.0,"Don't use Name Calling (""they are lazy, stupid, ignorant,  etc"")

There are better more healthy ways to motivate people. This is the age of information, go find them and then think about your communication strategy.Personally speaking I cared about these protests initially. But these protesters don't want to discuss. Rather, if you don't agree with their idea, you are labeled a ""bhakt"" and shunned. 
Then why would I or anyone who tries to have a different opinion would come out and fight.

The Assamese are protesting the CAB because there are too many illegal immigrants in Assam, and they want none of them irrespective of their religion.

The left is protesting the CAB because muslims are not included in it and they want all of them to be accepted by India.

Neither congress nor BJP are actually thinking about what Assamese people want.This is the stupidest law I have ever seen or heard.How are they going to prove anyone’s religion?  What if some one comes in and becomes a Muslim? Will they lose their citizenship? 
What about persecuted athiests in every Muslim country? And why bother doing this when you are already an overpopulated country with lot of poverty and can’t care for their own population?",CAA-NRC-NPR

2077,Watched 'Kaala' (2018) starring Rajnikanth and I think it is one of the most revolutionary movies from Indian cinema.,8,ez53oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ez53oq/watched_kaala_2018_starring_rajnikanth_and_i/,11,"Just watched yesterday after recommendation from a friend and got blown by the hidden symbolism and references which pans all issues and the roots behind  which our country is facing .
It is one of the few movies where you need to watch it frame by frame to understand the metaphor which the director wants to convey albeit in a mass movie style.


Rajinikanth and his aura might be at the centre, but the focus is Ranjith’s ideology that operates in the nooks and corners of the screen where our eyes might not usually wander

The film opens to crowded bylanes of Dharavi, with a voiceover detailing the struggles of its inhabitants, the “urban poor”, who were jotted on the margins of the success story of Mumbai and just like that, with the flip of a page, forgotten. Numerous buildings will come up in Dharavi, its denizens are told, bringing modernity and prosperity to their lives. But its people don’t want a 225-square foot cell masquerading as advancement; they want their own freedoms.


It is an anti caste and Ambedkarite movie but unlike other movies  the protagonist kaala here is a fighter who wears all black which he calls the colour of struggle,of hard work. 

The antagonist Hari Dev (Nana patekar )is a Modi like figure who consider himself as the saviour Rama ,dresses all white  and  fantasize  a clean,digital  and pure India at the expense of decimating the lower class. 

Kaala represents the dark, poor precarious world whereas Hari Dada’s neat, clean, white milieu is used as a mask to hide his malicious criminal psyche.

Kaala delves into lives and cultures, and shows us that contrary to the perception of ‘unclean’ – if at all there is anything ‘clean’ about the Indian city, it is thanks to them. The film, in the spirit of Baldwin, repeats that the way people treat you is testament to their own fear and inhumanity, and not your own inferiority.

The colour of black ( Periyar) ,Blue ( Ambedkar) ,Red( Karl marx) is beautifully portrayed in the climax .

Kaala is not only a display of alternative social symbols but it also builds a radical political alternative against the bourgeois rightwing politics of the current times. It showcases the growing democratic consciousness of the Lower Castes, religious minorities, women and other working class people in the depraved land of Dharavi. The films at its core represent the idea of democratic socialism. It retold the epical battle between the haves and have not’s in an actual sociological space",1580912590.0,"I felt this was an overused theme in Tamil cinema . Aren't there too many movies with similar themes starting from the 80sHere your 'Kaala (2018)' being enabler for fascist regime,

Amit Shah was just trying to test the waters and making an attempt to bulldoze the NRC.

2085,I rant.,16,fl5toc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl5toc/i_rant/,8,"This is just an expression of my personal opinions; if you disagree, I would like to listen to your opinion as well.

Firstly, I wish everyone good health and safety during this pandemic. Now that the entire country is virtually locked down, protests have stopped, and now is the time for introspection.

* I have a feeling that the protests are aiming at the wrong thing. Yes, the CAA-NPR-NRC is extremely diabolical and dictator-like; yes, it is going to choke an already suffocating Indian economy. But, there is something that the BJP-RSS have successfully diverted attention from. It is extremely unpleasant that this is not receiving the required attention.
* On February 14, 2019, a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive laden truck into a group of CRPF jawans, killing 40 of our dear soldiers. On 26 February, the Indian Government ordered an airstrike on Pakistan, an unprecedented move, in retaliation. The next day, the newspapers reported the Government's claims: the airstrikes purportedly killed 300 terrorists in a ""high-tech and luxurious"" camp, with swimming pools, etc.
* A Reuters report suggested that the airstrikes did nothing; the high-tech camp turned out to be a run down madrasa, the bombings barely damaged the madrasa, and there certainly weren't any ""300"" terrorists. BJP rode to power exploiting an anti-Pakistan emotion and romanticising the Indian Military, something that the Opposition could not oppose the BJP on, considering the election time and the sensitivity.
* Around two months ago, Dy.SP Davinder Singh was caught with terrorists. You just need to search his name up on Google to find out everything. When he was posted in Shopian in 2017, a terrorist attack took place. Worse, he was posted at *Pulwama* when the 14 February attack took place. The manner in which the NIA, headed by Y.C. Modi (who gave a clean chit to the cunt Modi for the 2002 riots), snatched the case from the J&K Police is extremely unsettling, as the J&K Police are capable of taking up such a case, considering the security status of J&K. Furthermore, even on the godi media channels, this issue was toned down heavily, signifying one thing - *the BJP-RSS combine knew about this and worse, they could have planned it.*
* They certainly planned it. They either let the Pulwama attack take place or planned it themselves. The fact that they used the Balakot strikes as an election strategy proves that they didn't chance upon the opportunity - it was months in the making. This is extremely dangerous, because we have two obese cunts with every desire to stay in power - even if it means treason or death. We also know that all the planning is done at Nagpur (RSS HQ) meaning there definitely was RSS's hand in it as well.
* We need to step up our vigil and bring this issue to light. Why haven't we heard an udpate since then? Why is it that even after a year, the govt. is unable to apprehend the Pulwama suspects?Now that our only means is social media, we **must** step up our pressure on the Government. A few ways to do that are: do no argue with RSS trolls on social media, flood the feed with questions, reports, anything you find. Do not waste time or energy retweeting or giving unnecessary attention to bigoted statements of attention-seeking whores.
* Secondly, Shaheen Bagh has to disperse. They cannot stay there, especially during a pandemic. It's a risk to their health and gives an opportunity to stoke hatred for them again. We must appeal to them to disperse; it will be in the interest of the true spirit of the country.
* Thirdly, it is 100% true that the only party that has the capability to oppose the BJP is the Congress. But not with fucking Rahul Gandhi. Let him get another time to prove his shot, not now. Scindia's defection should be an eye-opener. We *have* to pressurise the Congress to purge itself of the Family Power, and even all the politicians who stay only for power. Keep only those who are loyal and ideologically committed. Listen to Tharoor, hold elections for the President. It will take time to reorganise Congress, but there still are 4 years until the next elections.
* This rant is long and tedious to read, but I urge you to pay heed to my two cents. We must remember that we are fighting an ideological enemy, years in the making, disciplined, trained and dreaming for this very moment for years. Protests are good, but we fail to understand one thing: even our protests lack a bit in secularity. True secularism comes from celebrating diversity, not repressing it under the guise of equality and irreligious temper. Through our protests, we must spread literacy, education, upliftment of the Depressed and Marginalised. We need to hit BJP below the belt: its Hindutva agenda that is blatantly upper-caste arrogant and bigoted.

TL:DR - Make Sachin Pilot the head of Congress and Shashi Tharoor in South India. We cannot fight unconstitutionalism with the same breed.",1584630787.0,"Makes sense. Congress needs major changes. They need to be in action. Every democracy needs a strong opposition. And yes, I agree with the focus on anti-terror activities and how the focus should be there. But with godi media and their presence, i am sure they will somehow make this also work from them. I have seen that happen with yes bank crisis- an issue which should have been one which could have made people look into how the defaulters are these big shots of media and parliament, but no. They just kept talking about the 1-2 crore painting  and the slip by RG in the number of defaulters. But that is just me being skeptical and cynical.  overall, I agree with you. And yes, the protesters need to understand how no issue is worth losing life for. If we are alive, we can continue fighting.[deleted]",CAA-NRC-NPR

2087,The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective,9,f96yyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f96yyo/the_problem_with_current_caa_protests_from_a/,127,"Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations. 

Thanks for your participation.",1582646515.0,"\#1 Solid proposal

There is already a solid proposal with centuries of theory and practice. It's called **investigations.** *<OMG frantic screaming. Such blasphemy!>* You know, like in any other crime. Do you go stand in queue and give alibi each time there's a murder in your area to prove you are **not** the murderer? The burden of proving a person is illegal immigrant should shift to the government. And indeed that was exactly how it was until BJP I drafted rules to shift it onto the person.

&#x200B;

\#2 Existing refugee system

Actually, we don't have a refugee law. Any person deemed illegal immigrant cannot get citizenship by naturalization - that's the wording of the Citizenship Act '55.

What we have is an SOP followed by MHA. An immigrant can claim they are a refugee fleeing persecution by showing proof. Then government carries out a case-by-case evaluation and either grants few of them a LTV (long term visa) or rejects. Those who get LTV are no longer labelled ""illegal immigrants"" and therefore become eligible for naturalization.

**If this system is good enough for you, then why do you require a CAA at all?**

Also, CAA protests are not about foreign muslim refugees. The protests are mainly about its planned use as a pincer movement to aid disenfranchisement of *Indian muslim citizens* through NRC. Have you Shah's chronology samajhlijiye?

In addition, they are also about the arbitrary exclusion based on religions, arbitrary date (which means even hindu refugees get denied) and arbitrariness of location (which means pre-2014 refugees who settled in NE get denied).

This is a good article on why idea of NRC itself is immoral - [https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord](https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord).The problem isn't with the nature of anti-CAA protestors or their tactics but the whole intention of the act. IF, it's a big IF, the govt genuinely cared about the sikhs and dalit hindus of pakistan and afghanistan who have come here before 2014 and wanted to give them citizenship, they could have done it in a minute in the existing form form of the CAA. All they had to do is expedite the process and voila, they all get citizenship. No harm no foul. There was zero need to link religion with citizenship or make them prove they were persecuted on the basis of their religion ( you ever sit down and think how those poor souls are going to prove that to a govt babu?). 

I say bring back ALL the hindus and sikhs from afghanistan, pakistan and bangladesh in first class flights and bring them here, like how the Israelis do, just don't fuck around with the muslims for shits and giggles while you are at it, no? Since you are a right-winger I am sure you will agree with me here.Firstly few points need to be cleared very well to everyone.

1. This CAA does nothing, I mean absolutely nothing for any minorities living in Pak, Afg, Ban right now, it's for those who are already here in India, so all this advertisement about how we are saving minorities in these countries is fake.

2. CAA is not exactly about giving exclusive citizenship, it's about fast tracking the process of getting citizenship for these people, they would have eventually gotten citizenship even without CAA but it would have taken longer, just like the muslim immigrants/refugees would also be able to get.

3. The opposition parties of our country are absolutely useless, they will walk out of the parliament and cry in front of the media, why the fuck are you even elected as MPs if you can't stay inside the parliament and oppose something you see is wrong, fuck with your cowardice way of protesting and giving up, losers.

4. Personally I hate absolutely everything where religion gets involved, I am not an atheist and that's why I don't like my religion getting dragged in these shits.
I am not a fan of using religion in any debate, argument, decision making and law making process.

5. I am a supporter of the idea of CAA, i.e. giving citizenship to the refugees and immigrants who deserves, I mean who are living here for long enough and can't have anywhere to go back to, I support the idea of giving them citizenship and let them and their childrens live a meaningful life where they will get the basic rights like education, healthcare etc.

6. I think our country has enough resources and more than enough brilliant minds from different fields so that we can find a solution of every problem without involving religion in any situation, but I guess they just don't want to do it, which is really sad and as I mentioned above the opposition of this country is absolutely garbage level useless bunch of shits.",CAA-NRC-NPR

It is just a ruse. Slowly and gradually - the segregation , the discrimination will spread. Till it becomes all consuming

Based on a vague complaint by an MLA. But an action which resulted in the actual demolition of housing (admittedly, slums - but housing nevertheless)

So the problem wasn't slums (which would've been a noble cause) - but slums occupied by perceived ""foreigners"" 

As of today, another politician has raised suspicion that a bunch of construction workers were foreigners - because he saw them eating ""poha"":

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bjp-leader-who-thinks-eating-poha-makes-one-bangladeshi-has-united-all-foodies-against-him-2471355.html

Poha. Please understand.... ""P.O.H.A"".....

So - clearly - there is no actual basis for these actions & statements. But houses *have been* damaged and lives have been disrupted.

Now - a lot of the affected folks *did* have proof in the form of Aadhar cards, PAN Cards. 

So imagine the state of the folks - who don't have the (right\any at all) paperwork. Those folks shall be thrown into detention centres:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-detention-centre-inside-indias-1st-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-after-nrc-school-ho-2099626

So a protest was organized in San Francisco outside the Indian Consulate on 26th January against CAA,NRC and NPR. More than 400 people showed up but to our surprise the consulate was ready for protestors. They had made a small area with barricades around their building and hosted 25-30 people with pro-CAA placards. The people who were called by the consulate were highly abusive and provocative. The placards they were holding had words like ch\*\*tiya, pigs, calling us terrorists etc. They were also given a sound system to undermine our voices. It just broke my heart to see that these consulate people stooped to such low level.

These people would occasionally come out and enter anti CAA protestors and shouted Jai Shree Ram and hurled slurs at muslim people, called everyone Pakistani and went back to consulate premises.

Here's the link to some of the pictures.

2091,The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists,85,eis5lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eis5lf/the_problem_with_the_anticaa_protests_is_the/,51,"The CAA is a mistake. That much is certain. But unfortunately some of the messaging I've seen seems to harp on the fact that the CAA and the NRC will somehow benefit Hindus while affecting Muslims, while this is not obvious and I don't know if it is true.   
  
The CAA is for Hindus/Jains/Buddhists/Parsis/Christians from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, right? So if the CAA is introduced, it would prevent Indian born Muslims from being able to establish their citizenship during the NRC, if the NRC is done stupidly like it was done in Assam. That much is clear. Then these Muslims would have to wait for 11 years to be able to apply for citizenship in India, in the meantime losing their assets and their right to work or free movement within India. That's fucked up. Almost everyone knows this. 
  
But if the NRC is introduced, that would also exclude *India* born Hindus who can't prove their citizenship from being able to apply for citizenship, right? So *India* born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can *also* get fucked, right? The CAA explicitly says it only accommodates for refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If a hypothetical non-Muslim family cannot prove they are from India *or* the other 3 countries, they get fucked, right? What are they supposed to do? Forget the obvious examples of tribals or migrants. What is a family living in a MHADA compound in Mumbai supposed to do? What about Koli fishermen? 
  
So why are the anti-CAA protests revolving solely around how it will affect only Muslims? It will affect every single person in India. Even assuming a best case scenario and an error rate of just 5%, it will still affect 50 million people. It will affect everyone - not just Congress voters or ""libtards"" or ""sickulars"". It will affect bhakts also.   
  
Why are bhakts even supporting and defending this nonsense? They should be opposing this too, since (like DeMo) this will affect them a lot too. In fact, I now notice bhakts now criticizing DeMo when they blindly supported it in 2016.   
  
I predict they will begin criticizing CAA/NPR/NRC about CAA/NPR/NRC in a few years when some of their own citizenships come into question - because remember, depending on when the government sets the cutoff for NRC, we have to establish our citizenship to before that date by proving ""ancestry"" and not being perceived as a ""doubtful citizen"" : both these terms have no provision for legal documentation. How do I prove ancestry? What are ancestral documents?   
  
The BJP is arrogantly setting itself up for yet another clusterfuck purely motivated by 2 things: a hatred for Muslims, and the quest to plunder as much of India as possible. Remember, if we are declared ""doubtful"" citizens then while we are ""under trials"" to get on the NRC, the government can seize our assets as far as I know.  
  
Seriously it boggles my mind that bhakts who can also be affected by this issue are supporting it. This is not a Muslim vs Hindu or a liberal vs secular issue. This is a common sense vs brain dead arrogance issue. This is not a ""their side"" vs ""our side"" thing at all, even though the messaging has been about that. This potentially fucks every single Indian irrespective of political preferences, gender, ethnicity, caste or religion. Its complete madness.  
  
There are better ways to do this. I mena even the elections are done in a phased manner.

2094,Hindus are not in danger. Economy and democracy are in danger.,210,ehnbq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehnbq5/hindus_are_not_in_danger_economy_and_democracy/,17,"Hindu khatre mein nahi hai. Economy aur democracy khatre mein hai.

It's is often said by sanghis who claim that 'Hindu khatre mein hain' and that india will become Muslim majority by 2050, however the reality is that even if Hindus do not have any children and if the Muslim population grows at a rate of 2% per year, the Muslim population will only be about 360 million(36 crore) and for the Muslim population to even reach the current level of hindu population it will take about 80 years growing at a constant rate of 2%.

This 2% isn't even their actual growth rate, it's even lesser.

In 1951 census, the population of India was 360.9 million(36.09 crore) out of which 303.6 million(30.36) was Hindu and Muslim was 35.4 million(3.54 crore), in 2011 census, the population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore)  of which hindu population was about 965.6 million(96.56 crore) and Muslim population was about 171.8 million(17.18 crore).

So this means, from 1951 to 2011 census, the contribution of population growth of Hindus is about 78% and Muslims is about 16%. So no, india is not going to be Muslim majority and taken over in 2050 or something along those lines, it is just fear mongering by sanghis.

Also since india became more developed compared to 1951, the fertility rate has come down across ALL religions. More developed areas have lower fertility rates in general.

Right now, democracy and economy are in danger.

Our GDP has been the lowest at 4.5% since the past 6 years. You can't have $5 trillion economy in 2024, if the economy is slowing down like this, we need a double digit growth to accomplish, yet since every quarter, the economic growth is sliding down.

Several sectors of the economy are experiencing negative growth. This [article](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown) explains the problems pretty well and also talks about solutions.

As we also know democracy is also under threat, look what's happening in UP, Delhi and many other places, dissent is being shutdown. Many protesters are getting beaten, getting shot, some of them are getting killed. Dissent is also stopped by bringing internet shutdowns. India accounts for 67% of all internet shut downs, that happen across the world, the internet shutdowns in kashmir has been longer than 145 days, longest ever in a democracy. India has the most number of internet shutdowns in the world by far. India's rank in freedom of press index is dropping.

The opposition to CAA is being called 'anti-nationals' as usual. The CAA-NPR-NRC is deadly combo, it will have their way for a Hindu rastra and therefore it would be the end of a secular democracy. it will strip millions of Muslim of their citizenship. The financial cost of this will be insane.

The NRC in Assam costed about Rs. 1,220 crores which has a population of 30.6 million(3.06 crore) which is about 2.2% of india's population. Out of that, 1.9 million(19 lakh) were could'nt prove their citizenship. The cost of this would be Rs. 399 per person.

If we apply this to whole nation, whose population is 1.37 Billion(137 crore), it would be about Rs. 55,000 crore. Building one detension centre in Assam, which could detain about 3,000 people costed about Rs. 45 crore.

Detaining even 50 million(5 crore) people, this would cost about Rs. 7.5 lakh crore. For comparison total budgetary expenditure for health and education was Rs. 8.4 lakh crore in 2018-19.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

Link
 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

From Jadavpur University to JNU, from Bengal to Kerela, it is the left that is on the streets. Kerela, as you know, was the first state to refuse implementation of the bill. They are now also the first state to go to Supreme Court against any Central govt law, for the first time in history.

In Bengal too, the Left Front parties were the first who started to protest against CAA (started since October 2019 against NRC). They were the first to protest against NPR and threatened to destroy detention centres if they are built forcibly. The bourgeois media (imcliding the likes of NDTV) focuses on TMC whose leaders have no problem meeting with the PM and continue the work of NPR, despite protests. They refuse to create a national front against CAA.

Left Front parties was the first alliance which sent letters to all the CMs requesting to not implement the CAA.  Despite potential risks of their only govt (Kerela) to be banished.

The Congress is uninterested in leading any serious movement against CAA. All they do is call some half-hearted meetings that no one attends. The states with Congress govt do not play a frontal role to lead the protests in their states.

The Right understands this well. You don't see Liberal organisations being attacked. It is the Left orgainsations and unions that are being attacked by the Right.

Still, the Liberal organisations are acting as if they are the one doing all work. Liberalism is the political wing of capitalism. It inherently leans rightward (since going left is opposing capitalism). Their enlightened centrist attitude (""both sides are wrong dude"") will never be able to remove the breeding grounds of fascism (which is capitalism).

2097,Kerala Chief Minister duty-bound to approach me: Governor Arif M. Khan,12,esfbrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/esfbrh/kerala_chief_minister_dutybound_to_approach_me/,5,"New Delhi: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the Constitution gives him many options and he will take a decision at an appropriate time on Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“As far as I am concerned, the rules of duties are clear. It is already established how the Chief Minister is supposed to approach me. The Chief Minister is duty-bound to approach me before he passes any such order. My role is to see that the state works according to the rules. I am not claiming supremacy,” he told The Sunday Guardian.

Khan said it was his duty to ensure that the rule, law and Constitution were followed in letter and spirit in the state. “Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Constitutional machinery does not collapse,” he said.

“Be you ever so high, the law is above you. You have to respect the law. Once the President has given assent to a law, as Governor, I have the right to protect it. I am moving in a Constitutional way. I am not a rubber stamp,” said the Kerala Governor.

The plea filed by the Kerala government under Article 131 of the Constitution on disputes between Centre and states, stated that the CAA violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practice religion under Article 25. The Kerala Assembly also passed a resolution earlier demanding scrapping of the CAA, claiming that the Act, which was passed after following due process by Parliament, was unconstitutional.

Saying that “dissent is the essence of democracy”, Khan cited the Constitution to accuse the Pinarayi Vijayan government of violating the law on key issues like passing a resolution or challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court, without keeping him in the loop.

“I have no problem with the government, Opposition, or anybody holding a different view on CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) or NPR (National Population Register). Everyone is free.

This has been repeated by Amit Shah, Narendra Modi and extensively on social media by IT cell. They even released a [video from 2003 of Dr. Manmohan Singh](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1207542398282162177/video/1) and have invoked [everyone from Mahatma Gandhi to Jawahar Lal Nehru to Rajiv Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vu4-foePyc) for justifying the existence of  CAB and then CAA.


As is with all things BJP this cannot be further from the truth, even without considering the upcoming NRC and NPR, CAA is a pure BJP propaganda at its best. Except for Assam maybe who are against all refugees majority of India is protesting for very different reasons.

This bill now a law should be opposed by every Indian because it is establishes religion as a basis of citizenship and excluding one particular religion from it. By doing that it destroys the very thing that makes us different and frankly much better than countries like Pakistan, Saudi or any other country which give preferential treatment to one religion over another. The very thing strictly prohibited by [Article 14 of our constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_India). It goes directly against it.

It is also worth mentioning that wording of the clauses in the bill as explained in the RS and LS is completely different from the bill which was actually passed. In all it's six clauses it makes no mention of 'prosecuted minority' or religion but simply refers to them as community. Henceforth excluding all but one community which seems to be the goal all along.

And lastly if government is so sure of their effort being noble and genuine why are they clamping down on every effort to protest it. If you're just and right let the public debate and truth will come out. As the official motto of our nation says सत्यमेव जयते|

This is all without adding it with NRC, once the act is coupled together it becomes clear what the real intention of this government has been all along. To demonize, de-franchise an entire community which has been prolific part of this land since the independence.

This is why each and everyone of us should fight against this fascist law which reeks of Nazi Germany and if you're one those who are happy that Muslims are being ""shown their place"" then don't forget Jews weren't the only one who suffered under Hitler.

2099,Have a few questions regarding CAA,12,epes4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/epes4q/have_a_few_questions_regarding_caa/,4," 1. What is the total number of immigrants/refugees that will come under the purview of CAA? The only information I could dig up was the comment by Union Minister G Kishan Reddy who said the exact data for determining the number of eligible refugees for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was yet to be prepared. CAA protestors and supporters seem to have very different numbers for this.  
2. Given that the cutoff date for CAA is 31.12.2014 - what kind of proof a persecuted person is expected to provide for proving his entry into India before said date? Also, what are provisions for refugees belonging to mentioned religions in CAA but entering India after the cut-off date?  
3. CAA is said to cover only persecution on basis of religion and not persecution on grounds of race, gender, membership of a political or social group, language, ethnicity, etc. But what is the yardstick for classifying or ascertaining this?  
4. NRIC and CAA are two sides of the same coin and as such cannot be viewed separately. Who is a 'doubtful citizen' under Sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 of the 2003 Rules, which says that ""during the verification process of the Population Register (or NPR), a step before the NRIC is prepared, an individual or a family would be marked as ""doubtful"" citizen or have ""doubtful citizenship"". It is neither defined in the 2003 Rules nor in the Citizenship Act of 1955. There is no clarity as to how local authorities will identify and decide on who is a doubtful citizen.  
5. Given that the NRC exclusion rate in Assam was approximately 6%, are we looking at exclusion of at least 7.86 crores of people? Will CAA act as a safety net for said people who belong to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian & Parsi communities?- a narrative that is being focussed by CAA protesters. What happens to people from communities (Muslims & others) who are excluded from NRIC and do not fall under CAA - Do they end up going before Foreigners Tribunals as in the case of NRC exclusion in Assam?  
6. What is the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam and what percentage of those will be eligible under CAA? The only info I got is Sriprakash Jaiswal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, made a statement in Parliament on 14 July 2004 put the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India at 20 million with the Majority being in West Bengal & Assam.",1579180585.0,"1. We will know the final number only after nationwide NRC, if that happens. Hopefully it doesn't

2. The rules and proof required for applicability of CAA is yet to be framed. Though Amit Shah had said in an interview that once CAA is passed no proof would be required as long as you belong to any of those 6 religions, there is an official govt clarification from PIB that's saying that rules and proof required would be soon defined and only those applicable would be given citizenship.

3. The classification is arbitrary in my opinion and as per many constitutional experts. The SC has asked govt to prepare its argument and the case is going to come up next on 22nd Jan. The burden is on the govt to prove why their classification is not arbitrary. But if they have a SC bench favorable to them, they might have an easy way out of it.

4. Yes the NRC and CAA go hand-in-hand and no less than Amit Shah has said this multiple times. The rules for Assam NRC are known while the rules for nationwide NRC is still unkown. The doubtful citizens rules is at this time at the discretion of the district authorities which is even worse than any rule that the govt can ever devise. The district authorities can mark anyone ""doubtful"" arbitrarily or maliciously or even politically.

5. Yes. BJP atleast initially planned CAA as a default safety net. But with now extensive protests, they seem to be taken aback. As a face saving measure, I think they are now thinking of defining rules for CAA. But the fact of the matter is, nobody can ""prove"" that they were religiously persecuted. So I am waiting to see what kind of comedy they do in trying to frame these rules and define the process. All those excluded from NRC list and without the benefit of CAA would be sent to detention centers after being stripped of their citizenship.

6. The total illegal immigrants identified through the Assam NRC process is around 19 Lakh far less than the 2 Crore number that was expected. And the various sources indicate that the majority of them are Hindus. I believe around 12-15 Lakh would be Hindus and they have the CAA safety net. Rest 4-7 Lakh Muslims will be sent to detention centers.This is exactly one of the points of the protests. All these questions have been hanging around for a long time, and the government as such hasn’t clarified anything regarding these. This has led to a loss of trust in the government by the people, and is only giving more weight to the arguments accusing the government of having ulterior motives. 

As for the 3rd question though, the reason of ‘religious persecution’ was provided in support of the bill, and not as a qualifier for getting citizenship. The bill does not mention the word ‘persecution’ anywhere in the text, and so there would be no necessity to prove that a person was persecuted on any ground as such. Everyone who belongs to the religions mentioned in the bill and satisfies the 2014 criterion would be provided citizenship, regardless of the reason they came to India.",CAA-NRC-NPR
2100,Not so frequently asked questions about NPR (yet),28,ef74tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ef74tb/not_so_frequently_asked_questions_about_npr_yet/,4,"**What is this NPR I am suddenly hearing about?**

NPR stands for National Population Register. It was defined and explained in the Citizenship Rules, 2003 (see link below), which were formed to execute the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. The first data collection for the NPR happened along with the last census in 2010. The data was then updated in 2015.

**Who is affected by this?**

Every ""usual resident"" of India. If you generally live in an area in India (for past 6 months or more, or plan to live for next 6 months or more), you are required to provide the data. It covers you whether you are a citizen or not. On the other hand, citizens who are not normally resident (NRIs) are not covered.

**Oh, so it's like census in regards of who it covers and the way it is collected. What kind of data do they want?**

Some of the data is similar to the census form.

**Huh? But we already have the census for that. Why do we need this?**

Well, the census data collection comes under the Census act of 1948 and that data cannot be used for any other activity. The purpose of that data is to use it for planning and other welfare programs. It's confidential and anonymized.

The NPR data is collected under the Citizenship Act of 1955 and Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. It won't be anonymized, nor will it be confidential. The purpose for this data is to help ascertain citizenship of an individual.

**What is different this time vs the 2010 collection?**

The differences are really the key. From a questionnaire taken from a pilot project that began in August, apparently you will now also need to tell the place of birth of your parents (do you have an idea of why they would need that? Wink, wink). This is a new data point and was not there in the original NPR (2010) data collection.

Also for the first time - you will be asked for numbers of your Aadhaar, driver's license, voter identity card, and mobile phone, if you have them. 

And did I tell you it's not planned to be anonymized or secured?

**Goodness! When is this happening?**

There was a gazette notification (see link below) issued in July 2019 by the government to prepare and update the Population Register in every state other than Assam. The field work will happen between April 1 and Sep. 30 of 2020. Expect a knock on your door then.

**But why are some people tying it to the NRC? It has nothing to do with that, right?**

Actually, the whole purpose of the National Population Register (NPR) is to collect the primary data for the National Register of Citizenship (NRC). This is really the first step. The NPR is supposed to create a list of all the residents of the country and then the NRC would take that list and identify people of “doubtful citizenship” – thus, by corollary creating a list of citizens."" (See the Rules document linked below)

**Hmm.. ""Doubtful citizenship"" sounds like a vague term. Who is going to determine that?**

Once you submit the data for the NPR, it will be verified for the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the NRC. The Local Registrar and their helper staff will scrutinize every single data point for each individual to come up with that decision. If they find that you citizenship is ""doubtful"" they will add a remark in the Population Register and inform you after the process is over.

**Don't tell me that “doubtful citizen” remark will really be used for the NRC.**

Come on. Of course it will be. We are not paying our Baabus for nothing. The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

**So, then it's my responsibility to remove the doubts of Sarkaari Baabus to be considered a citizen?**

Yes, but hey, you also have a right to cast doubt on others. A draft of the local register of the NRC will be publicly available. You can actually check your nosy neighbor's details and if your relationship is not cordial, can cast doubt on their information. You can object to the citizenship or a particular information of anyone before it goes into the final NRC. Of course, others can do that to you as well. But can't you pay a small price for .. erm.. eh.. the country?

2101,What is NPR? How does it affect you?,81,eez610,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eez610/what_is_npr_how_does_it_affect_you/,3,"NPR is first step of the National Register of Indian Citizens, which is the other name of nation-wide NRC. NPR is a collation of all ‘usual residents’ living in India. Under the Citizenship Rules, 2003, a National Register of Indian Citizens is to be produced after filtering citizens from non-citizens. 

How is this filtering done?

First a local officer “verifies” the list & issues notice to “doubtful citizens” from list of local residents. These “doubtfuls” must now prove their citizenship. Following this, a draft list is published.
If you think your inclusion in the draft list is enough, it’s not, because the rules permit objections to the inclusion of any name on the list. Presumably, anyone can file an objection. The decision of your Indianness is made by an officer.

NPR also collects sensitive personal information of every Indian, including passport details (~5.5% of Indians have passports).

Also, All-India NRC and CAA are both part of the same law, the Citizenship Act, added by Vajpayee-Advani in 2003 and Modi-Shah in 2019, respectively. [Vajpayee-Advani imagined an all-India NRC and Modi-Shah added a Muslim filter](https://theprint.in/opinion/vajpayee-advani-imagined-an-all-india-nrc-and-modi-shah-added-a-muslim-filter/339366/)

> As per the 2003 amendment, the Indian government shall count all its citizens and create a National Population Register or NPR. The government will then verify the citizenship of the people counted. Once it does, the verified citizens will become part of another document, the “National Register of Indian Citizens”.

[Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approves over Rs 8500 crore for updating National Population Register](https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1209401270605209600)

Note that the NPR will be carried out alongside the Census -- so most people will be confused, thinking it is the census rather than first step of the NRC.

India above everything is a democracy. But the ruling government has turned it into a revenge saga where every voice against it is seditioned.  

Any reason that goes in favour of government is strictly supporting suppression. 

A law is a law. Let CAA be implemented. Let NPR  be implemented but snatching a citizens right to protest, labelling them against the interest of nation, how can that be justified? 

The governments outreach program is aimed to gain support of like minded people and not pacify the dissenting citizens. 

There’s a reason Hon’ble is prefixed against union ministers and they are just ganging up now?
As if the GOVERNMENT will reward them for hate speech. The more the better, is that how those union minister works now? 

I am not here to change someones POV, I’m simply anguished that the democratically elect government is acting like the communist china in many aspects now. 

Also the Rise of BJP has shown me how weak and stupid most of the opposition parties are.

The very thought of child dying in the hospital should spark a strong reaction from us but there has not been the kind of outrage that this issue deserves.

This is something  that needs to be reflected on. Recently Hasan Minhaj called this compassion fatigue, ( Caring about every issue all the time). There are way too many issues in the country that need to need a voice and need to be fought and changed.But it's difficult to protest about everything all the time. This populist sentiment is reflected in the print and visual media as well, the news of the children dying should be blockbuster front page news but it has only got a small snippet on the major newspapers and the CAA Protests have taken precedence. 

The shelf life of the issues have a short life in the media and a short attention span among the people. I’m trying to say that we should strike a balance, at all the CAA Protests the people should say that they want a better nation with better hospitals, better working conditions , basic safety and security for women and they will keep protesting until they get it.

To,  
*The Hon'ble Ex-Chancellor, Jadavpur University.*   
SUBJECT: **Letter of Rustication to Kindly Terminate your Hon'ble Services Effective Immediately.**   
Sir,  
It has come to the attention of the general students of Jadavpur University that you were present on the premises of Jadavpur University in the evening of 19.9.2019, along with miscreants who hurled bombs, sexually assaulted women and vandalized sections of the university. Furthermore, you arrived uninvited to Jadavpur University on 22.12.2019. We have investigated your behavior and motives and come to the conclusion that they are shameless attempts to seek attention from students, thereby wasting our valuable time.   
Furthermore, on 23.12.2019, as part of the ongoing evaluation of university officials by students, you were asked a number of questions about the NRC, NPR, CAA; the SC/ ST Commission, violence unleashed on Muslim and other students and so on. We have found your responses to these questions unsatisfactory. They were as innocent of knowledge about BJP led police brutality on Muslim and other students as you are innocent of integrity. Academically speaking, your thesis holds no water and your defense is weak. Moreover, the students are convinced that your decision to stir up violence against students at Jadavpur University follows the party line of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We regret to inform you that we cannot attest to an unblemished record in your character certificate either.   
Keeping the above in mind, you are being informed of your rustication from the position of Chancellor of Jadavpur University. The students' body of Jadavpur University has also decided to disown you from the position of the Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal.   
**Your report card has been attached for your benefit.**   
**General Knowledge**: Less than satisfactory   
**Argumentative capability**: Poor   
**Sense of history**: Nil   
**Strengths**: Unwavering dedication to ignoring violence against students, activists and Muslims.   
**Overall character**: Spineless

#PAST
*****
The Kargil War happened on 1999. Post the war(and India's victory),

>The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was set up by the Government of India on 29 July 1999 three days after the Kargil War came to an end. The committee was set up ""to examine the sequence of events and make recommendations for the future,"" as mentioned in the epilogue of the final report and the ""Terms of Reference"" laid down in the executive summary.
> 
> Over a hundred senior military, civil service and intelligence officials, politicians, including former prime ministers, diplomats and journalists were interviewed by the high-powered committee over a period of five months. The report was completed on 15 December 1999 and tabled in the Parliament of India on 23 February 2000.Certain parts of the final KRC report, such as the findings, have remained confidential till date.

>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_Review_Committee

Another source suggests :
> A comprehensive systemic overhaul of the country's security and intelligence apparatus in keeping with the technological revolution and the need for integrated management structures was unfolded by the Group of Ministers (GOM) in a report submitted by them to PM on February 26, 2001. The GOM had been set up in April 2000 to review the national security system in its entirety and in particular to consider the recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee and formulate specific proposals for implementation. The GOM under the Chairmanship of Shri L.K. Advani also included the Defence Minister, External Affairs Minister and Finance Minister.

>Source:  http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/releases98/lyr2001/rmay2001/23052001/r2305200110.html

One among a huge list of things discussed in **GOM report of 2001** is ""Border Management"" (there are some redacted bits shown as dotted line further below). The initial sections give the rationale behind the importance of ""Border Management"":

> **Chapter V:BORDER MANAGEMENT**
> 
> India has 14,880 kms of land border running through 92 districts in 17 States and a coastline of 5,422 kms touching 12 States and Union Territories (UTs). India also has a total of 1197 islands accounting for 2094 kms of additional coastline. There are 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (area involved 7,110.02 acres) in India and 111 Indian enclaves (area involved 17,158.13 acres) in Bangladesh. In fact, barring Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Haryana, all other States in the country have one or more international borders or a coastline and can be regarded as frontline States from the point of view of border management.

the report goes on to say...
> Illegal migration from across our borders has continued unabated for over five decades. We have yet to fully wake up to the implications of the unchecked immigration for the national security. Today, we have about 15 million Bangladeshis, 2.2 million Nepalese, 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and about one lakh Tibetan migrants living in India. Demographic changes have been brought about in the border belts of West Bengal, several districts in Bihar, Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya as a result of large-scale illegal migration. Even States like Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been affected. Such large-scale migration has obvious social, economic, political and security implications. There is an all-round failure in India to come to grips with the problem of illegal immigration. 

>**Unfortunately, action on this subject invariably assumes communal over-tones with political parties taking positions to suit the interest of their vote banks.** The massive illegal immigration poses a grave danger to our security, social harmony and economic well being.
 
In the recommendations under this ""Border Management"", the report says:

> **ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION**
> 
> **Illegal migration has assumed serious proportions. There should be compulsory registration of citizens and non-citizens living in India. This will facilitate preparation of a national register of citizens. All citizens should be given a Multi-Purpose National Identity Card (MPNIC)** and non-citizens should be issued identity cards of a different colour and design. This should be introduced initially in the border districts or may be in a 20 Kms border belt and extended to the hinterland progressively. The Central Government should meet the full cost of the identity card scheme. Many people from the neighbouring countries [……………………..]* are tempted to cross over to India in search of better job opportunities. In order to prevent illegal migration in future, a 'Work Permit for Foreigners' scheme may be introduced, [……………………………………………….].* 

>A proposal for introduction of multi-purpose identity cards to all citizens and compulsory registration of nationals and non-nationals in the country is already under the consideration of the Central Government.

There is a mention of this ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"" in the PIB archive from 2001 - apparently the Govt was supposed to start implementation of this waay back in 2001: http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/HOME%20AFFAIR/2001-JAN-JUNE-HOME-AFFAIRS/PDF/HOM-2001-03-20_047.pdf

The recommendations on ""border management"" goes on as follows:

> For effective action against the illegal migrants, Residence Records of villages in the border districts should be prepared and regularly updated. This will allow easy identification and detection of illegal immigrants, until such time as the scheme of registration of all nationals and non-nationals is introduced.
> 
> **Indian Census primary data can easily help in the detection of illegal immigrants**. This information can be a useful tool in establishing the status of illegal migrants. However, since census primary data is confidential in nature, this matter needs to be further discussed with the Registrar General of India and the Ministry of Law.

A further section titled ""Citizenship, Passport, Immigration and Refugee Law"" under recommendations states:

> Children born to illegal immigrants living in India are entitled to claim Indian citizenship by virtue of their birth on Indian soil. **Therefore, in principle, Indian Citizenship Act should be amended prohibiting acquisition of citizenship rights by the children of illegal migrants born in India before 1 August 1987**. This would also meet the stipulations of the Assam Accord. However, as per the advice of the Ministry of Law, the provision can only be introduced with prospective effect. 
> 
> The MHA should take necessary action.
> 
> **As soon as the situation becomes more *propitious* for enacting a law in this regard, a law, for compulsory registration of all Indian national and non-nationals staying in India, should be enacted. This would help in preparing the National Register of Indian Citizens.**

And there you have the first mention of the NRIC - almost 20 years in the making. Looking at the Govt's actions recently with amendment act, the ""propitious"" time seems to be now in 2019. The actual digitized copy of the GOM report of 2001 is nowhere to be found in our Indian Gov websites but there is a version of it in one website: https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/GoM%20Report%20on%20National%20Security.pdf

As a result of this report being submitted and being accepted by the Govt at that time(2001), a flurry of changes happened thereafter. One of which is enactment of ""The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003"". This actually details the process and framework by which to build the NRIC (National Register of Indian Citizens as http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ states it) and eventually enforce the reality of a ""Multi-purpose National Identity Card"". We should have had the initial ground work for something akin Aadhar way back in 2003 but it never happened. (Read it in full here: http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Act&Rules/notifications/citizenship_rules2003.pdf)

This framework for gathering information, verifying, issuing citizenship remained as is without much progress till the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. After that, the government was quick to plan and deploy the exercise to create the National Population Register (NPR) for all residents, a precursor to the NRIC. The NPR has been created and digitised (check out http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-Common/IntroductionToNpr.html and https://npr-rgi.nic.in). The Govt then amended the Citizenship Rules,2003 with a Citizenship (amendment) Bill of 2009 (and few amendments happened in later years as well) to initiate the pilot NRC program in Assam.

*****
#PRESENT
*****
We can infer that, together, the Citizenship Rules,2003 and The Citizenship Act, 1955 have been amended multiple times over the years to support the eventual creation of a nationalized NRC(aka NRIC) with Assam being the pilot. The most recent one being tabled in 2016 - the infamous CAB - **Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill** 2016. As mentioned earlier, we will not go into the details of what the CAB means to the overall 'citizenship' debate and what issues people in north eastern region(specifically Assam) are facing due to NRC and CAB.

The bill is an ""Act"" now. Hence the media outlets have started referring to this as CAA,2019 - Citizenship \(Amendment\) Act of 2019.

> The Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019.
> 
> Subsequently, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship \(Amendment\) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament. The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on 10 December 2019, with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against the Bill.
> 
> The bill was subsequently passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it. Those voted in favour included BJP allies such as Janata Dal \(United\), AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, TDP and YSR-Congress, apart from BJP.
> 
> After receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act. The act will come into force on a date chosen by the Government of India, and will be notified as such.

#FUTURE
*****
Salt: It is obvious that this section will be based on pure hunch/informed opinion...

There *seems* to have been very extensive work done in early 2000s after Kargil war, to increase India's resistance and resilience to such events in the future. To a large part, that(Kargil committee report and the GOM report 2001 on the back of Kargil report) *seems* to be one of the most influential(you can see it mentioned in many annual reports the Home ministry/Defense ministry publishes: https://mha.gov.in/documents/annual-reports) and thorough review of national security - at least the one publicly available. So it is *expected* that (unless a review happens in that scale again) the Govt will follow the process/methods/framework suggested in The Citizenship Rules,2003 and would eventually try to create a baseline NRIC from Census data(as suggested in the GOM recommendations 2001) - *possibly* from up coming Census in 2021.

After so many amendments over the years, The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship Rules, 2003 as they stand currently have specific rules to infer citizenship in the ""Assam"" context, but has a very generic rules if it were to be extended to entire India. So there *could* be further amendments tabled so that it is tailored for the various regions across India that share international borders and are bound to have issues in 'identification of a citizen' due to that particular territories regional history(take Tamil Nadu, the Eelam issue and SriLanka for example...)

Steps *may* be taken to ensure the NPR(National Population Register) data is made more reliable and robust. The data from which *may* be used to baseline NRIC(National Register of Indian Citizens) - ground work for this *seems* to have already started based on Govt's actions. Aadhar *may* be re-purposed to become the actual Multi-purpose National Identity Card that the 2001 GOM report initially suggested. Given most countries around the world are moving towards a ""surveillance state"", this move of formalizing 'citizenship' and digitizing that data will give the Govt strong base for full fledged surveillance power. 

India doesn't have robust personal information protections in this digital age(compared to GDPR rules governing PII data in EU for example). So there is no telling how census data(personal in nature) may be used in the future. Is this a good or a bad future we are heading towards? How do they intend to use it? will they abuse it? will this NRIC plan even get fulfilled and a true national ID issued to citizens? - Time will tell
